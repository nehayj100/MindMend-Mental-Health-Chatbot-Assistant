 It did not help my burnout. I think that I do what a lot of people do, which is actually a symptom of burnout, which is depersonalization, which is disconnecting as much as humanly possible. And I think we learn that in training as a way to protect ourselves, but what happens with burnout or what happens when story after story after story is resonating too much as we kind of disconnect completely. And so we're no longer like that person as a person. We're sort of like this. We're not there like it's an object. You're listening to Inside Mental Health, a psych central podcast where experts share experiences and the latest thinking on mental health and psychology. Here's your host Gabe Howard.

Give us live in studio today is Dr. Jesse Gold. Dr. Gold is the author of the new book How Do You Feel? Which explores the challenges of caring for yourself when you care for other people? Dr. Gold, welcome to the show. Thanks for having me and please call me Jesse. Oh Jesse, thank you so much. You know when you reached out to me, you really grabbed my attention because you said mental healthcare workers like therapists, psychologists and psychiatrists are experiencing mental health crises and burnout and an alarming rate. Can I immediately thought to myself, when I wait a minute, if the fire station catches on fire, who do the firefighters call? What's happening here? Yeah, what if the answer is the firefighters call more firefighters? I think that is the answer. I'm not even being funny. Like you have to just call like another substation? Yeah, there's like this, I mean my therapist calls it a train of therapists but I don't know who the master of the train is, right? It has to end somewhere but there's one person helps another person and they help another person that kind of goes back and so all of us seem to turn to our colleagues for support which is challenging when our colleagues are also burning out and stressed out and dealing with the work. I think in our field especially, we like to pretend it's not hard because we don't have long hours all the time but we do a lot that is emotionally challenging and for some reason in training we talk about it but probably not enough and we kind of blow it off like, oh emotions even though we are people who deal in emotions. And I think that makes it hard in a lot of ways to even admit that you have anything going on because you're listening to people who have harder stuff in our mind going on and we also do a lot of comparison where we go, oh well I can't say I'm tired just because work is hard when my patient has trauma since they were three. You use the word annoying, right? I get annoyed too, right? Everybody gets annoyed. I get annoyed at my wife and I love her. I get annoyed at my mother and I love her. I get annoyed at my grandmother. She's my favorite person in the whole world. So I get annoyance but is annoyance the same as burnout or is that just the human? No, just the human. I mean so burnout is one of those words like so much in mental health that I'm sure in talking to other people you feel this is the case where they use the word that they don't mean what I mean or maybe what other people who actually understand mental health mean. So when people say they're anxious they don't mean they have an anxiety disorder they mean they're worried or if somebody is depressed they're not having major depression they're just sad, right? And burnout I feel like has come to mean something similar where people are just tired or work was hard or they're frustrated or annoyed from work and co-workers are interactions. And so those emotions come to represent burnout but what burnout actually is which is up to 50% in healthcare workers which is way more than most age-match populations similar schooling populations is this constellation of three things. And the first one is emotional exhaustion which I think totally makes sense so it can look like physical exhaustion because sometimes we don't notice our feelings or kind of disconnecting or or burning us out in some capacity before we're like manifesting it physically. The second one is that depersonalization that I talked about where it's just really disconnected from everything you're doing. Some people also say cynicism for that which is again instead of sort of being disconnected you're just pissed off all the time. That's the best way of saying that and the third one is a reduced sense of personal accomplishment. That's the one that I feel like people notice because either someone pointed out they're not doing something or they feel like they aren't doing something they're supposed to or they're behind and they notice that. The first two like feeling emotionally exhausted or being depersonalized feels very much like a work consequence in the work that we do. Like of course I'm emotionally exhausted I listen to 10 people tell me about their lives all day and they've never told anybody else that stuff. If that didn't affect me would I be a human being? And so I think we have this sort of baseline expectation that our job does some of that and it's easy to kind of push off and push off and push off is just a work consequence. Another phrase that you used was they start looking at their patients like objects. Again I'm not a doctor I've never practiced I don't have patients I don't know but isn't a good thing. I hear surgeons talk about this. We're not emotionally involved we have to make split second decision so as far as we're concerned they're just meat and there's a part of that that's hard to hear but there's also a part of that to like really reassuring you're making the right decision based on the data not based on your feelings your biases your emotions etc. So isn't it good for a mental health care worker just to look at their their patients is like okay well you're just a cluster of symptoms and I'm going to give you the best coping skill to manage your symptoms but beyond that you're just number five seven six on my docket today. There seems like a protective factor in there. It's definitely protective I think it can be protective to an extreme sense like as much as you would like your surgeon to be not emotional while they're cutting you I think afterwards you would like them to come up and talk to you like a human like you'd hope it turned off at some point so maybe there are times where being disconnected makes sense or where there's times where pushing your emotions aside can be good in medicine especially but I think having it all the time is problematic and I also think in mental health professions we are the tools right we're not using knives we're using ourselves and if we don't have an empathetic connection that makes you feel like you can trust us and we're just like hey who are you here's a drug you'd be like that person's not good at their job so there is a degree of skill of managing sort of empathy plus depersonalization and removing yourself from the conversation that you learn over time but can get extreme depending on how much you're trying to protect yourself. I want to travel down two separate roads here and I want to make sure that we hit both of them I want to make sure that we talk to the mental health workers who are listening and they're like okay so how do I defeat burnout but I also want to make sure that we're talking to the patients who are listening and you're like oh my god why am I going to call these people they're all they're all burnout they just told me that they're not handling it and you know Jesse keeps calling me a piece of meat and that might be okay but maybe not I don't I don't know where I am here. For the record I did not call anyone. That is fair that is fair that is fair that is fair. We just use that as an analogy an example if you were the I'm just curious though let's talk about the patients first it if you're a patient listening to this on a human level you care right we care about our therapist we care about our doctors but what do you want to say to the patients who are thinking well I don't I don't want to go to therapy now they're all they're all messed up. So you know I think in a way you're right so the relationship and the fit is across the board and data how therapy works so if you like that person you're going to have more success if you feel like you can talk to that person you're going to have more success that's the major factor so you do like that person if you keep going back and you're getting helped right and so it is important that our relationship is strong I think there was a time during the pandemic when my patients were asking me how I was doing and they actually kind of paused for more because I think you know we do that so much is like how are you how are you how are you how are you and you're like fine whatever and you know we were learned in training to not really talk about ourselves and if people asked a lot of things to kind of push it back on you and it meant more about the person asking the question than the fact that you were actually concerned and in the pandemic I really felt like a lot of my patients were like no no no seriously how are you you see healthcare workers you're in healthcare this isn't something that you can just blow past and like they were genuinely concerned about me in the part selfish like are you could still be here because I need you to do this and I need help and also sort of part that must be really hard and I hope that you know that we see that and that was weird for me because I don't think I'd ever really had such obvious I can't make this stuff up anymore I'm pretend I'm fine all the time and I started answering at least that question pretty truthfully and I think it helps my patients to know like that I was a human and affected by stuff but I was okay you know my therapist always tells me I hope you know that I wouldn't show up if I wasn't going to do my job well that if my work was interfering or I was sick in some way or things were going on in my personal life that I couldn't manage my job I hope you trust me enough to make that decision and that I wouldn't come if it was going to be a problem I'd like to tell you everyone thinks like that and everyone's paying attention to their emotional health enough to do that but I do think if you really care about your therapist one actually ask them how they're doing I think it does make a difference but also to be aware that like they know they need help and they are getting it if they need it and if they show up they're showing up to be there for you and they think they can. So just to hit this hard and really clarify if you're a patient who's seen a psychologist a psychiatrist a therapist any mental health professional it is more than okay to ask them how they're doing if they're doing okay and if they believe that they can take care of you that's not an out of bounds question or inappropriate in any way. It isn't but you might have someone who acts like it is I think you know I'm in my mid 30s and my training was a little bit different I think if you look at some of the older therapist and older psychiatrists they kind of carry a Freudian mentality which is a lot more disconnected and a lot less self-disclosure the behavioralists like the folks that do cognitive behavioral therapy and dialectical behavioral therapy which is newer techniques there are a lot more self-disclosing and a lot more human and the stuff that they're doing and I think that's rubbed off across the mental health spectrum and field and for me and my colleagues I would see that as a kind gesture I think if you kept asking you asked a bunch of questions about my life I might be like this is not the right setting for that this is about you I want to spend the time on you you know I would probably throw it back eventually because it isn't about me but it's a pretty common question and we should be okay with that you know more prying stuff you might get more push back. This is the perfect segue into the mental health side so I want to talk to the mental health practitioners the other doctor goals the other Jesse's the other psychiatrist psychologist mental health workers who are experiencing burnout what can they do about it and also keep it mind while you're answering that the patients are going to be even dropping because they want to know what you're doing about it as well but I also do want to provide some takeaways for mental health professionals who are listening who are experiencing burnout and they're like hey what do we do here? Yeah I mean my books called How Do You Feel and the Real Reason is because I realized I never asked myself that question I would go days and days and days and I'll be asking every single person I talk to that friends and co-workers and patients and then my therapist was like but have you ever like checked in on you and I was like what do you mean check in on me like in some formal weird way where I'd be like Jesse how are you today and she was like kind of actually like what does that look like and I had never done it and it's weird and totally uncomfortable but doesn't take a long time and actually makes a difference and if I had done that I would have noticed earlier signs instead of just being completely spent and thinking oh I just how where did that come from it's like flew out of the sky and I'm all the sudden sleeping all the time right and I think a lot of us do that patients and and therapists and other mental health professionals and health care workers alike because we blow past a lot of things either saying well that's just how we're exposed to make me feel or because we're not paying attention to ourselves in space at all.

And for me like an early warning sign is if somebody sends me an email or unfortunately patients send me a message I sometimes get very very angry and it's not about the patient it's not about the email it's about the fact that emails and messages are asks and needs and people need me and want me for something and if I'm like feeling burnt out and out of capacity my first reaction is ah like I can't do this I'm gonna throw my computer or I'm just gonna ignore this for a while and I'm sure people have that reaction in their life and it you know I had to ask what that was about and I really figured it out and understanding that for me has made it so if I start to get like that or I start to feel angry I go oh I'm I'm inching towards not being in a great place I need to do something about that and that's a easier place to do something than when you're falling asleep after work every day because when you're falling asleep after work every day you have to take time off you're at the point where you need a vacation where you really need time off even though you know that's gonna be imperfect too but you know when you get it to a 10 out of 10 you you're not gonna want to do yoga right like if someone told you at a 10 out of 10 to do yoga you'd punch them in the face because you'd be like that's a dumbest thing you suggest you want me to do what right now and that happens so much when I talk about this stuff honestly because a lot of those people are at 10 out of 10s so if you're at their best pay attention to yourself in the equation notice what burnout or anything where it feels off like actually looks like to you so you can make adjustments practice what you preach some you know I don't think we're very good at that so we can rattle off coping skills blindfolded and we don't use any of them and so clearly there are ones in there that we could try out and see if we like for ourselves and that we might just completely blow off because we think that we know what we're doing or we think we can therapist ourselves because we're trained not great um you know paying attention to that stuff and figuring out what skills work for you is important I'm a big fan of having external mental health providers for us too for the same reason that we can't really treat ourselves like we want to we have skills too but my therapist notices so much about me that I wouldn't notice otherwise and I think having her and not just my friends who also are often psychiatrists and therapists is helpful because it's a different barrier and it's like somebody else with external eyes who can lay them on you and help um those are the first two things I come to mind the third would be paying attention to the good things in your day so our brains are evolutionarily designed to be like those berries may do sick don't eat those berries right so all you remember about the day was you ate poisonous berries you don't remember like before you ate the poisonous berries you had a really good conversation with her best friend right because the poisonous berries got in the way and for people who are burnt out but in general it's sort of like there's poisonous berries everywhere your whole day your whole life whatever it's just poisonous berries and so having a chance to be like what was good about my day and at the end of the day reflect on that is really helpful and important and we don't do that enough I keep a little box of anytime patients tell me nice stuff or um you know somebody says the same thing about a talk I keep it in a box and when I'm like today was horrible I'm bad at my job nobody likes me I'll go to the box and be like somebody likes me right? I love the part where you basically said we should take the advice that we're giving to others it reminds me of one of my favorite phrases which is take my advice because I'm not using it I know that it's good advice so I want you to have it now I myself am not going to listen but you should follow along I think that there is a belief I think that there is a belief in mental health care which is that if your mental health provider needs mental health help but that means something went wrong but we don't believe this elsewhere you know for example if your oncologist needs cancer treatment from another oncologist we're like well yeah right if a if a general practitioner has a general practitioner where like that makes perfect sense to me but when a psychiatrist has a psychiatrist or a psychologist goes to a therapist or a therapist goes to a therapist where like oh they're crazy and I know that patients believe this I've been really surprised to learn in this job interviewing doctors like you that this this stigma is in your you guys have created this for yourselves you all believe this as well the number of doctors psychologists therapists that I talked to that are just like well I know I don't need that my patients need that and I was like that's really interesting to me that's really interesting can you talk on that for a moment for sure so I've been on med since college same med no change same there was a time during 2020 like right early on where there are a bunch of people on social media talking about being on meds and their treatment that were health care workers and it was really rare because people never talked about their mental health and they were doing it really openly and I talked about going to therapy which I've read it on like 10 times on here so you can tell I'm very comfortable talking about therapy and I didn't talk about being on meds even though I'm a psychiatrist I prescribe I spend all day telling people exactly like me that it's the same as blood pressure meds or cancer meds or whatever you need that you need it you take it it helps you go back to work and do your job better right I've been saying that forever I believe it inherently it's not like I'm being inauthentic in those conversations but just like you're saying I realized there was a block to actually applying it to me that there was something in there that I didn't realize was there that came from the ethos of probably both are just general culture around mental health but also then you go to medical school or whatever kind of training and they tell you different things and you see different things in that changes you even more that's problematic and I hadn't even realized how much that culture had like infiltrated my brain because I do very much believe what I tell patients and so I think if someone like me who spends all day doing it feels like that of course other people do and I think it's not the right way of looking at stuff because in so many ways because I've gone to therapy I'm better at my job because I go to therapy I can handle my job and because I'm a medication I hate me in my job so the hiding it and the avoiding it scares me more than the people who actually choose to get help for it and are stable because of it I think that is a really good message for both our mental health care listeners and for our patient listeners if you have a therapist a psychologist a psychiatrist who is seeking mental health help they're practicing what they preach they believe in the system so much that they themselves are a patient of it versus the oh well minus fine so they don't believe in the thing that they want you to do not to say that they can't be fine I think that's important I mean even you said you know 50% burnout rate that means 50% non-burnout rate I know we're almost at a time we don't have a lot of time left but I sort of when I asked you an open-ended question okay just like a psychiatrist yeah I just like to think I'm interested exactly exactly I've interviewed enough psychiatrist who have picked up some tricks yeah but you are we gonna get out of this the the burnout rate didn't used to be this high this this wasn't a problem 10 years ago and is the burnout rate for mental health care professionals going to be 50% for the rest of our lives or is this getting better yeah I mean so as a person who studied this stuff and cared about the stuff pre-pandemic it was a problem pre-pandemic and a lot of those numbers even some of the 50 percent were actually pre-pandemic which is sad and then we talked a lot about it in the pandemic because it was clear where that was coming from and it was these new stressors and these new changes and these unknowns that people couldn't deal with and that led to kind of compounding and underlying existing problem that should have been dealt with a little while ago and so it made a worse problem and I think that systems tried to adapt pretty quickly to need in the pandemic and stop the bleed across the board so mental health and physical health as much as possible but it is a long tail trauma is not like something that sticks on a timeline and in so many ways this was like a national trauma for all of us but especially folks who work in front line work and health care and so we should be thinking about it like how do we help support this for the long term and hope that it gets better because we want our people to stay in their fields right the biggest risk for everyone is that people leave that we train them they're really good we really like them and they leave because then you don't have a mental health provider and we already have a shortage all over the country especially in child and adolescent but the fear as a patient is that they leave we need to be focusing on this and thinking about this do I think it's going to be a mess forever I really hope not like I would hope that the pandemic put into focus how important this is and for us personally but also as a system and that systems will continue to support ways to change this you know the mental health system being inherently broken causes a lot of issues for patients and the people who work in it and I think changes to that from a policy perspective and access perspective would make a big difference even just in sustaining our our care and supportive patients but that takes time and so I'm hopeful too that talking about it will change the culture and that's a first step you can control that I can control how I feel I can control what I'm telling you and I can control like maybe that helps you be more comfortable asking for help in the future and I talk about my stuff for that purpose I wrote about it for that purpose because I really believe that if we could change our culture we could change how we're training people at least you'd feel safe going something's off and I need help and that is a big change from what it's been and the systems changes I'm hoping are blatantly obvious to people based on the pandemic and that they'll continue to sustainably invest in it and care about it but I can't control the systems as much as I can control telling you a story and making you know that it's okay that your clinician sometimes struggles and it's okay that we're human and that's also just normal and so that's where I lay my hat is trying to change the culture around all of this well having a prominent psychiatrist to talk about this and write a book about this and speak publicly on it it is only going to help so thank you so much for doing it and of course Dr. Jesse Gold's book how do you feel is out now check that out one last question is this a good book for patients and mental health practitioners or is it just geared towards mental health practitioners I think it's for everyone so if you are a mental health practitioner you hopefully will feel seen and understood by it in ways that you haven't before like you will see yourself in some of the stories and feel like oh I'm not alone and I think that's really important and maybe learn some skills you could use for yourself if you're a patient it gives you a behind the scenes behind the curtain kind of you people like that they watch Grayson had me but also you know in a lot of ways it helps you understand that people taking care of you better I think it also will give you skills and we suffer from a lot of the same things you do so the topics like burnout or perfectionism or overwork are going to resonate no matter if you're in mental health or if you're a health care worker you're going to go oh that's me too and caregiving is such a broad topic too right you describe my book as the problems we have with caring are for ourselves and we care for others like who doesn't do that and so many ways yes I define it with health care which is this really specific kind of population that does a different kind of caregiving but every single person does caregiving in some way and so I would hope that you know you would see yourself in that and find it helpful for that as well Jesse thank you so much for being here yeah thanks for having me Jesse
