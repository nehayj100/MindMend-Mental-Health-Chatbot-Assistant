 You're listening to Inside Mental Health, a psych central podcast where experts share experiences and the latest thinking on mental health and psychology. Here's your host Gabe Howard. Hey everybody, this is Gabe Howard, host of the Inside Mental Health Podcast. And for the last nine years, we have released an episode every single week, including over the holidays, over the summer. I have never taken a break. Well that schedule just got a bit cumbersome. So instead of releasing weekly episodes, we are going to switch to buy weekly episodes. It's going to be the same great podcast with the same great guests and the same cool things happening. But instead of happening weekly, it will happen by weekly. So tune in next week for the next episode of the Inside Mental Health Podcast. You've been listening to Inside Mental Health, a psych central podcast from Healthline media.
