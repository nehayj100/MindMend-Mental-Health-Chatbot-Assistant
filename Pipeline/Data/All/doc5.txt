being here thank you for allowing me to have you in my pocket at all times to be able to text you and ask you weird and wonderful questions and most of all thank you for being just you know such a such a kind warm-hearted person who who always brings their best energy there serve others so thank you for being here what makes me happy to be with you um you know I think of Happiness as a daily practice and appreciating the people you love Is Just critical to it yeah yeah and and I really appreciate

you you said you were happy to be here when we were just filming it a couple of seconds ago and then you're telling me that I I looked good and I was saying to you it's because I've been doing all the right things and following your advice and I remember I think it was our second interview not our first one our second interview I was saying to you like I have only one cheat day a week now and you just looked at me and you were like well you know why they call it a cheat day right and I didn't I was like what do you mean

and you're like yeah because you're cheating your brain like you know and and you gave this beautiful explanation and I was thinking you always have these things that you say that stick with me and if anyone doesn't follow Dr Danny Layman on Instagram make sure you go and follow him because I love how you post the brain scans of befores and afters of on a certain drug and without a certain drug on weed without weed like I just think that the way you communicate brain health is is fantastic and so great for

you know my generation the generation after me I think we have so much to learn from you so thank you for what you're doing and how you're doing it too and always makes me happy to see you and your wife as well uh and this has probably been the longest I haven't seen you since you scan my brain so that was so much fun that was so much fun I was very relieved to know that my brain was doing all right so well when you see it you develop a relationship with it and you want it to be better and it's hard

to hurt it once you see it yeah that's so true and it's it's crazy to me that we don't get exposed to our brains like you don't ever see your brain which we use every day that works for us every day and you have no access to it apart from see your body you see you know different organs maybe sometimes but the brain's not talked about a lot what is our brain what does it do and how do we develop a relationship with it because I feel that people are very confused with what is the brain what is the mind you know what

does it do what does it not do I think there's a lot of stuff out there how would you describe it well it's very clear to me after all the scans I've done that your brain the physical functioning of your brain the moment by moment physical functioning of your brain creates your mind and if your brain's not right your mind's not right and there are a lot of spiritual teachers that'll separate the Mind from the brain but you can't because just think of Alzheimer's disease you know very damaged brains and they're very

damaged Minds The Go I mean people that act in ways they never act if their brain was healthy that they don't remember people that they're deeply in love with and so if we want a healthy mind it actually starts with a healthy brain and you know I've had the blessing or the curse to scan over a thousand convicted felons and over a hundred murderers and their brains are very damaged so if your behavior is so bad you end up in a cage and they're not thinking oh I have to understand evaluate rehabilitate that

person's brain and then that better and that helps all of us stuff stafsky once said you can tell about the soul of a society not by how it treats its outstanding citizens but by how it treats its criminals and it's you know when I first started scanning people I didn't really have an opinion on the death penalty I just really hadn't thought about it I thought of Free Will as black or white you have it or you don't and then as my work became known defense attorneys would send me people did really bad things and their brains

were so damaged and when I would go to court a lot of people hated me for that you know if you have a bad brain and you did something terrible you don't get to go home but should you kill them I mean it's a really important question and I'm like no you know it's not the sign of an involved Society to kill sick people I mean you have to protect Society from them but what I've seen is if we rehabilitate their brain they can have a meaningful life and people just aren't connecting it's your brain it's

easy to call people bad it's harder to go why and oh can I fix it what are the things that damage our brains because I think what we find is we often think like oh that person was totally normal and then one day they just changed or we say things like oh yeah if you just met them like they were just quiet and calm like you would never have noticed anything and then they did this horrific thing like what are those habits what are those patterns that start damaging our brain because I don't think we're aware

as you said we never see our brain we don't really talk about it we don't really know much about it what are the things we do since birth that damage our brains that could lead to something as Extreme as that well even before birth yes so since marijuana's been legalized in many states babies born with marijuana in their bodies has gone up Seventeen hundred percent I mean it's a ridiculous amount so even before before you're born what happens in utero can damage the trajectory of your life to have more behavior problems they have

more attention problems they have less empathy for other people and then you know as you go through life this standard American diet is damaging brains you know you talked about how healthy your diet has been I follow this guy on Tick Tock for some reason my tick tocks has gone crazy and he he looked at his blood sugar before and after Pop-Tarts and Pop-Tarts was like the worst thing he looked at almost worse than Coca-Cola and but what are we feeding children I mean in public school free lunches

Pop-Tarts which means we're damaging their blood sugar levels we're damaging their weight and we're damaging their brain and I have a mnemonic called bright Minds which helps me remember you know like B is for blood flow low blood flow number one brain Imaging predictor of Alzheimer's disease so Netflix right not in front of the TV too often not exercising that damages your brain probably the number one thing that causes brain trouble your brain is soft about the consistency of soft butter your skull is really hard and has sharp

bony ridges mild traumatic brain injuries ruin people's lives if you said hey Daniel single most important thing from 210 000 scans mild traumatic brain injuries physical right from snowboarding falling off a horse football soccer physical abuse will do it falls car accidents um you know and people are texting and driving and texting and walking and there's three million new concussions every year in the United States which means over the last 30 years there have been 90 million people that have had

concussions it's very common and a common cause of depression homelessness addiction suicide panic attacks ADHD wow yeah I mean when you spell it out that clearly I think what I love about you is I think the two times I have done an interview and then when I was with you I just go away going I need to so I need to do something for my brain I need to figure it out right and it's it's a good thing like I enjoyed that healthy sense of an Awakening and a healthy sense of fear because I think we are so scared of

being scared in society today like we don't want to listen to the truth because it's scary it's inconvenient it forces us to change something if someone could do something starting tomorrow what is the thing that someone could do waking up tomorrow that could be better for their brain what would you say that is well you know and you happier I talk a lot about the tiny habits the smallest things that'll make the biggest difference and brain and mental health it's a daily practice just like physical

health right as I said you look really great that's a daily practice right you just don't do that one day a week you do it every day if you want a really great brain and a really great mind their habits every day and some of my favorite every day is this good for my brain or bad for it I I just like when my daughter she turned 19 yesterday and when she was little we played Chloe's game and Chloe's game was is this good for your brain or bad for it frozen blueberries so two thumbs up God's candy or avocados oh two thumbs up

God's butter hitting your head with a soccer ball no very stupid thumbs down right and so just playing with her with that question that takes three seconds right I mean it doesn't take long and people go what's good and what's bad second graders know it I went into her second grade class put 20 things on the board and I went separate them for me and they got 19 out of 20 right so I got a 95 percent and the only thing they got wrong was orange juice which they put in the good category which is like way too

much sugar yes and so whenever you unwrap sugar from its fiber source right turn fruit into juice it turns toxic in your body so you have to be really careful with that so that's one two whenever you wake up in the morning today is going to be a great day you have to nudge your brain right we have a conscious mind we have an unconscious mind we have a self-image and your subconscious is paying attention to the words that the conscious mind is saying and so if you're like oh I don't want to get out of bed today is going to be a

bad day you're gonna have a bad day because you just programmed your subconscious mind to do that every day when my feet hit the floor today is going to be a great day and then my favorite of all of them is um when you go to bed at night and bed is so important because if you want to have a good day it starts the night before is what went well today so when I go to bed I say a prayer and then I go what went well and I go on a treasure hunt because I'm purposefully looking for what are the right things that happen

and I look for the micro moments you know like what's the smallest thing and for me where I live I see a lot of hummingbirds and butterflies and I just I just focus on them and I've been doing this for years and it's so helpful and about two and a half years ago my dad died and I was an awful awful day and when I went to bed that night I said a prayer and then went what went well today and then the voice in my head you know started criticizing me like you're a bad kid and you don't love your dad

and whatever but because it's my habit I went what went well today and I saw this interaction between my mother and the police officer and it was so funny and so beautiful that just made me smile and then I thought of all the texts I got from my friends who found out about my dad and that was peaceful and then I just thought about holding his hand before they took him away and I went to sleep because I'm mastering my mind and not being a victim of the situation didn't mean I didn't grieve I still grieve I

still miss him but it's these Habits Like every day to direct my mind to help me while taking care of my brain yeah I love those practical tools because in effect what we're trying to do is change our thought pattern right we have a pattern as you said to wake up and say I'm tired and we put it on snooze and then we get up and then we're having breakfast and we're like I'm still tired and then we get to lunch time and we're like looking at the clock and we're like I'm still tired and then by the end then I'm still

tired but then we're up at midnight watching Netflix or whatever it may be saying I'm still tired and then that becomes our reality that we just continue to feed that fatigue and we're just more and more and more tired whereas when you nudge your brain in a different direction as you said and you said today's going to be a great day you now start making great choices because you want it to be a great day but what I love about what you've defined and this is different and I appreciate it is that

you don't talk about positive thinking you talk about accurate thinking as being a healthier way to live and I really like that clarification because I think the positive thinking approach can also be quite toxic like you just said about your father it's not that you didn't feel grief it's not that you don't miss him like of course those are very real human emotions but you know how to direct them can you clarify for our audience today what is the difference between accurate thinking and positive thinking or positive thinking

is I can have this third beer and it won't negatively impact me or I can drive at 125 miles down the freeway in the rain and it won't hurt me positive thinking is I can stay up and be on my phone until two in the morning and it won't have a negative impact they did this great study out of Stanford Lewis Turman 1921 evaluated 1400 153 10 year old children and then they followed them for 90 years looking at what goes with success Health and Longevity and the don't worry be happy people actually in the beginning

of the book I talk about the lies of happiness and this is one of the lies don't worry be happy they died the earliest from accidents and preventable illnesses I have an older brother and I adore him but he's like 150 pounds overweight I always sort of wanted to be like him because I'm intense and I work hard and I've always got projects and he's like off at three o'clock playing golf and you know he just seemed to not have a care in the world but my health is so much better than his because I worry about it and so you want

to have the right dose of anxiety people with low levels of anxiety go to jail because they don't like think oh if I do this this bad thing could happen but obviously too much makes you suffer and I love the verse in the New Testament John 8 32 know the truth and the truth will set you free and I want to live my life in truth so I want to tell myself always so what's the truth so if I think Tana never listens to me I'm like well is that true right it's another little habit right to always carry around those

three words I don't have any tattoos but if I did is it true would be one of the tattoos because I don't want to believe everything I think and that's very important you your mind create trouble you know thoughts they come from all sorts of places they come from your ancestors they're actually written into your genetic code I don't know if you ever read the book it didn't start with you yes of course yeah amazing I love that book and trauma and successes actually get written in our genetic code and our

thoughts come from the voices of our moms our dads our siblings our friends foes the news you listen to which by the way is no longer the news anymore let's just be really clear they bastardize that industry and it's about tribalism and money and it's not about news I start every day with the good news network it's just a cool app I have no financial interest in it I just love it I'm always smiling you know sending uh articles to my kids and the music you listen to I actually did a study on rap

country rock and classical music and heavy metal we did a memory task with high school students and heavy metal was the worst classical was the best the the second best was country which shocked us wedded wedded rap fall in the uh right behind um heavy metal oh wow wow because that's like one of the biggest forms of music today is rap and hip-hop so and music so influences how we feel and so you want to be careful with the inputs because you might not think they matter but your subconscious mind's listening yeah

absolutely well that's why I want to ask you this is really interesting to me because so I've been listening to Jazz in the car now jazz is my new jazz is my new I usually don't listen to anything I usually just talk to myself when I drive that's been like my habit for for years is I see driving as a moment of spending more time with myself so I generally drive to nothing but when me and my wife are in the car together we both like music and recently we've been listening to jazz music together but

what I find really interesting about what you just said is that there's a difference between what feels good and what is good for you so someone may say I feel good when I eat junk food when I listen to music that isn't good for my brain and when I drink but when I miss out on that meal I don't feel good when I choose classical music I don't feel good and when I choose to eat healthy and maybe don't drink as much I don't feel good and so what I'm fascinated by is our relationship with feeling a certain way

versus being a certain way so when I started to have to remove refined sugar from my diet which my wife encouraged me to do I didn't feel good about that like that was painful I didn't enjoy that feeling in my mind right or when I started to go to the gym every day or hike where I hike outside here every day now and when I'm working out I don't feel good about it but it's good for me so I started to discover that the things that are actually good for me don't always feel good so how do you approach the idea of

feeling a certain way because I feel like everything that I do that's good for me I didn't feel good about when I started doing it now I choose it because now there's because you're getting the benefit correct the benefit I'm also feeling the pattern shift now if I uh so I still get a craving for junk food I still have that craving sometimes and maybe once a month now I'll be like or I'm gonna have a burger like I'm gonna eat you know like a burger and fries and whatever and now I don't like the taste

of it like after I feel really regretful and I'm like I didn't even like that I need to remember that then now I've changed my tastes so now it's changed so tell talk to me a bit about that like why do we always want to feel happy and feel good but we don't often make the right decisions secret number four is love food that loves you back and during a relationship I want you to love what you eat but I also want it to love you and so if you're in love with alcohol and alcohol is clearly toxic to your brain for so many reasons

brain and your body then it's sort of like you're in an abusive relationship and you know I just want people to think about what do you really want do you want that mountain of fries or that swimming pool of alcohol or do you want energy do you want Clarity do you want memory do you want Vitality do you want creativity and ultimately what what I want is I want to feel good and I want to be good and I want to do good and that comes from a brain and body that work right so I don't want to feel good now but not later right that's a

four-year-old's mindset I want to feel good now and later so the things I do day in and day out I love now it just it takes a while sometimes to change your habits the brain is lazy it just wants to do what you've allowed it to do so what you said is just so beautiful it's like well I still get the cravings and I'll give in and then I'll go why did I do that yeah that's right I genuinely feel right because then I just don't I just don't feel awesome so for that momentary pleasure it's like well is it worth it does it

fit so another tattoo I'm going to get someday does it fit so I recommend this is actually part of secret seven live each day based on clearly defined values purpose and goals and quite frankly Hedonism it's not on my goal list it's it's not in my value list and Hedonism so giving in to every craving I have is the enemy of happiness because it ends up wearing out your dopamine or pleasure centers in your brain and I always talk about you on a drip dopamine don't dump it because when you dump it with the

fries and the alcohol the porn you don't have much left and so then you have to go back and do it again and all of a sudden chemicals are controlling you rather than you are controlling you the dopamine gets so addictive and as you said with the pleasure centers now we're having to the same amount of what we had doesn't even fulfill the amount of pleasure so we have to have more to hit the same amount of pleasure as far as I understand is that correct like it's absolutely true yeah and fame uh wears out the pleasure

centers in your brain and I've been blessed I mean I'm friends with you Justin Miley and and you know we talk about this over and over again how Fame is just such a trap because you know once you know like had a video go viral and it was like 40 million views and I'm like oh it's so exciting and so when the next one gets eight million views you're like well that sucked and you realize just you know how stupid that is you have to be very careful and you want to drip dopamine how do you drip dopamine

how does someone do that let's say someone who's not getting 40 million views or 8 million views but they're posting on social media they're eating a burger they're having that glass of you know alcohol every night whatever it may be like how does someone learn to I love that idea I'm thinking how does someone practically drip dopamine because that's really it's the micro moments of Happiness so for me I mean it's like holding Tana's hand and then but noticing and feeling her skin and feeling the

warmth the softness it's it's like being present being connected or seeing the hummingbird uh watching the sunrise or the sunset depending on where you live it's being present noticing what you like way more than what you don't like plus sunlight drips dopamine pumpkin seeds drip dopamine omega-3 fatty acids I just gave you a present of our vegan omega-3 because I know you're vegan and people have been wanting it for so long but all the vegan Omega-3s they don't have EPA in them so Omega-3s there's EPA

and DHA they're almost all DHA but EPA is critical for mood for Focus for circulation and it's the first product on the market that I'm know of that is just loaded with the right balance of Omega-3s and what is the difference between EPA and DHA they work on different systems in the body both of them are absolutely essential and they're essential which means you've got to get them from an outside Source your body doesn't make them and people who are vegan it's really hard to get healthy EPA and DHA levels from flax

seeds and avocados for example yeah no I can't wait to start taking them I'm really excited what am I going to notice what's gonna be like well your Skin's already good but your skin your hair your nails that's the things people notice right but their mood is better brand new study out just today omega-3 fatty acids help decrease the incidence of depression also helps with focus and helps with memory it's just critical because they make up the fats in 20 five percent of nerve cell membranes in your brain I mean that's

hugely important the reason why I find this so fascinating is I think so many of us are trying to solve a mental challenge when actually it's a physical brain tangible challenge right like I'll meet a lot of people are saying General feel focused I feel cloudy I feel no energy I feel lethargic what do I do to get motivated and it's like well no no the motivation is not the issue it's like you're dealing with a lot of other stuff physically tangibly that could be solved and then with good values good

purpose good goals you can actually go in the right direction but just having a good set of goals and targets and values is not going to solve the fact that your body is crying out for attention and I think I was definitely in that space for a long time in my life where I'd like had such a strong mind that I didn't realize how much I was is weakening my brain and that actually if I strengthen my brain my mind was even stronger my body was even better and you know it was all interconnected and so

for anyone who's who's listening to this I want you to remember that if you've got an energy issue a fatigue issue a focus issue like this is the podcast for you like this is what I want you to listen to because chances are it's because you're missing out on some of this stuff like there's there's a part of your diet or something that's not going into your body well and if you think of it like hardware and software yes that setting goals which is so important and not believing every stupid thing you think which we'll talk about

is so important but those are software programs and you got to have the hardware that will run it plus I hate the term mental illness and you and I have talked about that before it's it's not mental it's brain and when you call someone mental you shame them when you call them a brain you elevate them so we need to change the discussion um and mental illness is in right everybody's talking about their mental illness and but it's the wrong discussion the discussion is about brain health and yes you have to program it

but what's happening in our society now it's one of the reasons I wrote the book we're the unhappiest we've been since the Great Depression that depression tripled from February of 2020 to August of 2020. unbelievable never seen anything like that and children suicide skyrocketed depression anxiety drug abuse skyrocketed and children and it's like the pharmaceutical industry is winning that the incidence of antidepressants anti-anxiety medications like Xanax went up 20 percent in teenagers that is a

nightmare because it's the wrong solution and I'm not opposed to medicines it's never the first thing I think about it's like let's get your brain and your habits right and then we'll see what you need and more than half the people taking medicine really don't need it last year 337 million prescriptions for antidepressants in the United States that's insane that I mean yeah it's alarming I think we've all experienced it in little uh micro doses of our family our friends the news but then when you hear it as a

collective it's super painful I mean how does a society that's going through so much pain how do we collectively heal because that's like that we're all we're further behind because of the pandemic it's like it was already tough now we're really dealing with if someone's dealing with a friend or family member or someone in their life who's going through that it can feel overwhelming for anyone like not everyone's a trained psychiatrist not everyone's trained as a therapist to be able to support that

kind of individual where would you suggest someone starts if someone in their life is really spiraling or struggling well I would start by following me on Tick Tock or Instagram or you happier or the end of mental illness there is this is a completely new way to think yeah and I dedicated my book the end of mental illness to my nieces and right at the beginning of the pandemic we adopted them because their mom and dad couldn't stop using drugs and I am so proud of them because of how well they're doing by just getting

the right supervision the right love the right food and the right habits now they grew up in trauma do you know that Ace test adverse childhood experience oh we should talk about it yeah please um it's a test and originally done by the CDC and Kaiser and it's ten questions on did you experience early childhood trauma so things like physical abuse emotional abuse sexual abuse parents who divorce parents who were addicted incarcerated you watched one of your parents being beaten in domestic violence okay so 10 of these questions

so how do you score do you score zero like you had no trauma I score one my wife is an eight because she grew up in trauma and she wrote about it in her book The Relentless courage of a scared child the nieces we adopted it's a nine if you score four or more you have an increased risk of seven of the top ten leading causes of death if you score six or more you have a twelve hundred percent increased risk of killing yourself you have a higher risk of depression addiction virtually every bad Health thing and our daughter is a

one so eight to one that's the goal right how do you take your trauma heal it and not give it to the next generation and when I met Tana I just dearly loved her I mean she's beautiful she's smart she's awesome but when I learned about the trauma I gave her 10 sessions of EMDR it's a specific psychological treatment for trauma it stands for eye movement desensitization and reprocessing she ended up going for a year because there are a lot of stuff to work out but change the trajectory of her life she's

like my best friend we like never fight we get along we have the same goals we don't live out of the past we live out of the present and what we want for the future and so many people live with trauma and they're living being controlled by the traumatized eight-year-old in their lives when they don't have to be and so part of being happy is dissipating the traumas from the past where can people do that test that sounds fascinating the way so they can go online and just search for adverse childhood experiences NPR has a free uh

version of it online and you pretty much know once you take it how long does it take to do just like three minutes oh wow it's very super it's just 10 questions oh wow that's basically yes or no but um but you know if you're a four or more getting help and amdr is so cool I want to hear more about it I'm so glad you raised it because I was like I've I've had a few clients I'm coaching right now and they've been working with someone else in the EMDR space obviously that's not my expertise but I yeah I wanted to get

your thoughts on it like explain if anyone who doesn't know what is the EMDR not the name but like what is it as a practice what you do it's actually an eight-step practice is you take a good history and you're looking for like what are the top 10 traumas you've had in your life and you do this with it you do it with a therapist uh with somebody who's trained and certified in it then you begin to Target so what's the worst one and what's the negative belief with that and what's the positive belief that you

would rather believe and where do you feel it in your body and so you hold that image and then imagine just being on a train and we get your eyes to go back and forth or sometimes they'll do alternate tapping on your knees or this thing called The Butterfly hug to do alternately while you bring that up and while you're on the train you just sort of see where it goes and it'll often go to the early traumas heighten them but then with the eye movements it helps the brain integrate it from an adult perspective rather than

living as a four-year-old's perspective and it takes the distress from like an eight or nine out of ten to zero and it's so cool and it's one of the fastest therapies because a lot of times people go to a therapist and they'll talk about the trauma and they just feel worse because what they've done is they've brought it up they've like say subconscious let's pay attention to these awful things you've been trying to forget but it's the integration and I did a study that we published in the Journal of neuros

Psychiatry and clinical neurosciences a great journal on eight police officers who were involved in shootings and they couldn't go back to work because they were traumatized because you know whatever you think about the police I work with a lot of police officers most of them are just kind caring service oriented people and they don't want to hurt anybody and so they were devastated couldn't go back to work I scanned them and in their brain there's a pattern for trauma where there are emotional brain

was working too hard and after an average of eight sessions their brain had calmed down and they all went back to work with EMDR with EMDR wow and so and with the MDR there's no you're not under anything there's no substance it's just no and in fact just sitting down talking to you I began I made this connection because what psychedelics do and people asking me about that all the time now and I'm not a fan of it um because I think it's risky and I get to see the Fallout of people doing it that have bad trips what psychedelics do

is they begin to fill in some of the holes and the ruts in your brain like you know if you've been traumatized and I'm bad I'm bad I'm bad or it's my fault it's my fault my fault it can help dissipate that for some people but their side effects with EMDR there's no side effects and you come out of it Freer so my first experience with EMDR so what I do in my profession is you know I've often said I've been bleeding on The Cutting Edge because psychiatrists don't look at the brain which is completely insane but when I

started doing that 30 years ago my colleagues like hated me it's like no you shouldn't do that that's not what we do we make diagnoses based on symptom clusters we don't need to know about the brain which I'm like you people are insane but I got investigated by the Medical Board in California for like a year it was the worst year of my life and I had an EMDR therapist working for me in my office and one day I went into Dr Lendl and I'm like I am not okay do this thing on me and after an hour I left her office and I didn't care I'm

like it'll whatever will happen will happen you know I love to say my friend Byron Katie says argue with reality Welcome to Hell and my anxiety just went away and ultimately they dismissed any complaint against me and I've obviously been doing this a long time but I just saw how powerful it was I didn't have to stay attached to the pain I I mean I'm fascinated to try it myself now and and like I think that's the only way to know and I but it's great to hear that again I just to clarify I think what you're saying is

that this is a great practice it helps you move along and then all the habits still have to be in place because do you feel like people doing it yeah right it's like others you can just go back and like well like dancing is a great brain exercise but if you drink while you dance you're completely messing up the benefit yeah yeah that's great tabletops brand new study out today I'm so excited that um Rocket Sports people who play racquet sports live longer than everybody else 16 longer longer than

Runners longer than anybody else I love that because I play ping pong tennis and pickleball but no I literally pay I play all three of those I'm getting a ping pong table I play tennis and I start playing pickleball and it's like it's so much fun it's easy you only need one other person easy to do and they're good for you and it's fun and you don't need to be that good yeah and it loves you back yeah so you just have to find what are those habits what are those activities I love that love me back yeah that's

fantastic I want to let everyone know if you don't have you happier already which is the book that we're talking from make sure you grab a copy because we're you know literally touching the surface but the lies of Happiness are fantastic there are 11 lies in here that we're told we've talked about a lot of them today having more and having more of something like love sex Fame drugs uh don't worry be happy we talked about that positivity mindset we talked about advertisers and fast food we talked

about needing you know Tech technology we talked about and we'll talk a bit more about that too we talked about constantly being in the news constantly being aware of the news we talked about alcohol marijuana we've touched on a lot of those lies but I really want you to dive into it because I think those lies are what's governing our Pursuits but focusing on the seven secrets of Happiness to talk about that no one else is talking about you said the brain needs targeted nutrients every day to boost happiness what are some of those

targeted nutrients because you also gave me along with the vegan omegas you also gave me theanine could you tell us a bit about why that's so awesome for calm Clarity and focus well especially if you tend to be anxious right theanine from green tea helps you focus and calm you at the same time and yes green tea does have a little bit of caffeine but why green tea is better than coffee is the theanine helps calm down the effects of the caffeine and but theanine by itself is just magical for so many of my patients

and those gummies they taste great and they have no sugar right because sugar for me would be a brand violation and we don't do brand violations where does canine come from what is it from Green Tea okay that's where it comes from right yeah it's one of the active ingredients in green tea green tea catechins are another uh great substance for your brain my favorite of all of them we talked about Omega-3s but my favorite is saffron and I've been following the science of saffron for over 20 years because over 20 years ago

a study came out showing it was equally effective to Prozac and I'm like whoa um and there's folklore in India India yeah my mom is gonna love this moment of this podcast she tells me it's saffron all the time that if you're too happy you must have had saffron so now there are 24 randomized controlled trials head to head against antidepressants showing that it's equally effective to boost your mood but as opposed to antidepressants which can decrease sexual function saffron increases sexual function increases pleasure increases

responsiveness even in some studies sperm motility saffron has been shown to enhance memory and I'm like memory mood and sex and at the beginning of the pandemic right when my dad was sick I'm like I make something called happy saffron with saffron zinc and curcumin I've taken it every day since and I just think it's just a nice thing to help keep people balanced but then the supplements in large part depend on your brain type so that's secret number two is what makes some people happy makes other people

miserable and a one-size-fits all with happiness is just not reality some people need novelty and they love surprises where it's type two there's five primary types that's our spontaneous type but type 3 the persistent type they hate surprises and love routine and so know your type and the type of your spouse and children and then ask yourself every day I do something that makes me uniquely happy and this book's going to help people figure out their type you have the types in the book so we have

the balanced brain type the spontaneous brain type the persistent brain type sensitive brain type at the cautious brain type and the book helps you diagnose and figure out which brain type you have so you can do this with your friends your family your partner your your kids and that's going to help you understand what they need more of or what they're missing in fact my nieces they had friends over and they were in the spa at home and they were taking the ace quizzes with their friends and knowing each other's brain type it was

such a great discussion yeah I love that how do people as in walk us through some of the process you created to help people figure out their brain type well you know based on my Imaging work yeah I'm like I was looking initially for the one type of you know where's depression in the brain and then I realize oh there's not one type of depression there's seven where is add in the brain well there's not one type of ADD they're seven that's why Ritalin is controversial for some people it's a miracle for other people it's a

nightmare and it depends on how your brain works and then I realized I was seeing patterns of Personality like if your frontal lobes work too hard you tend to be worried and rigid and if things don't go your way you're upset and I have of my five girls two of them have this pattern and I know no matter what I say to them they're gonna dismiss it it's gonna bounce off it's like they wear Teflon and so for like shopping I love shopping with my girls and I go oh do you like this the answer will be

immediately no so for them I know their type and I wait for them to show me stuff and if I want them to do something I'll actually ask them the opposite of what I want them to do because they're just you know these people they're just sort of naturally oppositional and if I want them to go to the store with me I'm going to go I'm going to go to the store you probably don't want to go with me yeah it's like what do you mean I don't want to go with you we don't spend any time together that approach of personalization and

individualization is just so needed especially in healthcare because like you're saying you can and that's what me and my wife see that in us like odd diets are completely different for us to be an optimal level and our workouts are completely different like my wife is a high intensity workout person I'm a low intensity workout person I just don't enjoy high intensity it doesn't work for me I I feel more inflamed I feel you know more heated in my body where I don't need that I'm pretty you know

active heat as it is and then my wife really enjoys it it's really great for her body she feels great for men so I just think it's so fascinating that we keep trying to take like whatever works for everyone must work for me and we get this trend or this fad and I think this diagnosis of your brain type though I think this is the best thing that you possibly could have done for us the persistent people they need carbs they if you put them on a ketogenic diet they get depressed and they get angry I was

on Rachel Ray's show and she was the persistent brain type and on national TV we're talking about this and she said I went on a low carb diet and I was so mean I wondered why my husband didn't leave me because the persistent brain type needs serotonin and if you think about a higher protein lower simple carbohydrate diet it's a dopamine diet it helps you focus but if you give it to the persistent type they focus more on the things that make them unhappy and make other people unhappy so the wrong

diet can cause divorce and so you have to like Target it to the person but it's also why people get addicted to Sugar because sugar is a simple carbohydrate and sugar raises serotonin and it makes you happy have you ever wondered when you go to a restaurant why they immediately give you bread and alcohol because both of them drop your frontal lobe so the bread simple carbohydrate raises your blood sugar and your pancreas sees it and produces insulin insulin drives tryptophan into your brain tryptophan makes serotonin and you

feel pretty happy which is why people get addicted to pastries and bread and pizza and donuts and then they give you alcohol because it drops your frontal lobes so if they give you free bread and offer you alcohol they're going to make more money because you're going to order things you said before you walked into the restaurant you weren't going to order including dessert that is so true and I love it when they give me bread it's like my favorite but it's not anymore but that's like my favorite

thing that I love it when I walk into a restaurant I'm like do you have a bread basket like you know it's such a it's such a habit right it's it's all habits what I find that happiness is such an interesting goal that's what I meant by like we want to feel happy but the things that you have to do to feel happy are not necessarily the things you want to do if something like initially initially that's what I'm saying until it switches until it switches and oh by the way and I start the book with this happiness is a moral

obligation because you know people like oh you're writing a book on happiness that's fluff can't you do something more serious and I'm like but it's a moral obligation why because of how you affect other people I guarantee you if you ask someone who was raised by an unhappy parent or married to an unhappy spouse or raising an unhappy child whether or not happiness is an ethical issue so this is important uh for us to seek happiness in the context of Health unbelievable everyone that is Dr Daniel

Amen speaking about you happier this is the book I genuinely genuinely recommend this book I think you know so there's certain books that will just transform how you think about your brain I know that working with Dr Danny Layman has been really powerful for my brain so many of the habits I've developed consciously or subconsciously have happened through our conversations I mean when you told me about uh Rocket Sports that's what led me to start playing tennis and then I started playing pickleball and then I picked I'm

getting a ping pong table and it was just there were these really tiny things that we've exchanged in our conversations that have made huge differences in my life and so today when you told me I look great I was like yeah thanks to you Dr Dennis because of you uh but I want you to go and grab this book The Seven Neuroscience secrets of feeling good based on your brain type the book's called you happier uh Dr Dan Lehman you'll know uh this will be no surprise to you we end every interview with a fast five which is our final five

uh every time that we do this so you have to figure out new answers every time you come on uh but these are your Fast Five so the first question is what is the best brain advice you've ever heard receive or given every day ask yourself this question is this good for my brain or bad for it it's so simple it's the mother tiny Habit to have a great brain for the rest of your life okay second question what is the worst brain habit advice you've ever received so what is worse brain advisory you've ever

received everything in moderation which is the Gateway thought to hell it's the Gateway thought to cheating as soon as you hear someone say everything in moderation they're going to do something bad for their brain wow explain let's let's dive into that a little bit because I feel like that's such a common misconception that people have oh I need to have a balanced life and a balanced diet right so yeah but balance for them when they're saying moderation means sugar right or it means alcohol or it

means marijuana or all the things that doesn't matter well it means Comfort it's their excuse it's it's one of the little lies people tell themselves that keep them fat depressed and feeble-minded yeah let's let's do I actually want to take a little segue let's talk a bit about marijuana because I think that that's become so popular I did it a bit as a kid I messed around with MIT means I never really got into it you did my brain scan there's no there's no signs of it because I was never too deep into it uh and obviously

since I lived as a monk I don't I don't mess around with anything so I haven't you know I haven't drank alcohol for 16 years or something like that and like no marijuana for 16 years um but what is marijuana doing because I feel like so many people do feel like they need it or like it's benefiting their life or it's become so normal now like what are the chat what are the issues well they need it because it changes their brain to need it in order to feel normal what is it doing it in a way to make people feel like it's

helpful what's calming things down right in the brain so I published a study on a thousand marijuana users every area of their brain is lower in activity and then I published the world's largest Imaging study on 62 454 scans looking at how the brain ages and I looked at well what accelerated aging and marijuana was the second worst thing to accelerate aging the worst thing was having schizophrenia but the second worst thing it surprised me quite frankly it was worse than alcohol worse than marijuana it dulls slows down nerve

cell firing so if you have a busy brain and you're anxious you feel like it's helpful but it's also been shown to damage some of the structure of neurons and kids who smoke or use have an increased incidence of anxiety depression and suicide in their 20s kids who use have a 450 percent increase risk of developing psychosis and people have been I've been a psychiatrist 40 years we've all seen cases like that their cases now because marijuana is so much more potent than it was when I was growing up that there's a word called

scrometing which is screaming and vomiting at the same time that if you're in an emergency room people like oh oh this person's poisoned with marijuana not to mention the 1700 percent increase in babies being born with marijuana and the trouble that that causes it's like people go to that before they learn diaphragmatic breathing before they learn meditation before they learn self-hypnosis before they go for EMDR to deal with their traumas and that's just not right like let's do the non-toxic things first

rather than you know and that's my problem with psychedelics it's like you know maybe at some point if you have severe PTSD that's not responding to anything that could be helpful but have you done the basics first yeah and the challenge I find that most people say is that non-toxic things are slow you have to learn something right it's not immediate like meditation for example or as you know meditation let's take uh what was the first thing you said you said um diaphragmatic breathing I can get you to break a panic attack in two

minutes yeah if I just get you to breathe yeah four seconds in hold it for a second eight seconds out hold it for a second do that for three minutes you're gonna feel so much better so much calmer this isn't hard yeah but it's not taught and so people don't know oh yeah and then they're like so where's my dealer that's the hard part that's the hard part we're not taught and then we go for the quick fix and then we get addicted to the Quick Fix because it's a quick fix and then that becomes our reality

and that's right but there are other quick fixes that are quick yeah if we just are taught yeah um like you know one of my favorite things is killing the ants the automatic negative thoughts whenever you feel sad mad nervous write down what you think just write it down and then go is it true and then write the opposite Tana never listens to me Tana does listen to me and then go is that true and you'll often find the opposite of the thought that's torturing you is true I do that all the time with my wife I

feel the same way doing with your spouse is very helpful when I'm like all righty doesn't care about me and then yeah asking myself right he does Carol yeah like oh I can find lots of reasons yeah it's it's beautiful and then you don't have to believe yeah the negativity because where you look determines how you feel if you find the negative you're going to feel negative and if you find the beautiful you're gonna feel beautiful absolutely all right question number three this is that was a great

tangent I'm glad we did that uh question number three uh what is your current purpose how do you define it my current purpose is to change how psychiatric medicine is practiced to take it out of the Dark Ages to end the whole concept of mental illness and create a revolution in brain health I love that what a great purpose uh we're here to support we have a big Gala I'm so excited December 7th at the Beverly Hilton Hotel uh the end of mental illness uh we're going to be what's the goal of that what's the

what's the purpose you didn't have in so the purpose of the event is to really raise money for the foundation for research and the whole concept of mental illness for Education we actually have a new preschool course to teach kids to love their brain called brain Thrive by five and service to raise money especially for First Responders because you know they got hurt really bad in the pandemic uh so that they can get this new brain health way we're so excited Carrie Anna Nava is going to be the emcee of the event Miley Cyrus says

she's going to come so we're excited awesome congrats very excited for that I've got two more questions for you then I'll let you there you go all right question number four is um and is that something everyone can come to by the way that's yeah it's a public event so we're gonna um start advertising it soon perfect December 7th December 7th Beverly 2022 Beverly Hilton Hotel it's a public event that people can buy tickets to come to right to support the cause that you just mentioned correct amazing love that uh

we'll put the details in the notes as well so everyone has them question number four what's something you wish you knew about the brain earlier in your own life so 1991 I'm 37 and I'm a double board certified psychiatrist I was the top Neuroscience student in medical school and I don't care about my brain at all and I'm like and I was overweight and I was only sleeping four hours a night I was chronically stressed and I scanned my brain because I just started scanning so I scanned everybody I knew I scanned

my six-year-old mother she had a gorgeous brain and when I scanned myself it wasn't healthy and I was horrified and um I come from a very competitive family and I just really unhappy that my six-year-old mother had a better looking brain than I did so I developed a concept called brain Envy I always say Freud was wrong penis envy is not the cause of anybody's problem I wanted a better brain and I think I've spent the last 31 years just trying to get a better brain wow so you just wish you knew about that I wish I knew about that

earlier I wouldn't have played football um and I wouldn't have drank diet soda like it was my best friend do you want to tell us a bit about that because I feel like soda people have agreed it's bad but now diet sod has become I used to think diet soda was free right I mean it's like no calories but the aspartame and what we know now was sucralose is really bad so there's a brand new study out looking at sugar sucralose or splenda and Stevia and they did brain scans and cognitive testing and Stevia nothing happened before or

after it seemed actually pretty safe that's amazing sugar new learning dropped Splenda was the worst new learning drop long-term memory dropped and you got a surge of slow frontal lobe activity which means it deactivated your frontal lobes and I'm like and you know the yellow packets are everywhere yeah it's over it's so scary it's like I don't know how the I don't know how they haven't figured out a way to just improve the food bank as a whole through all these standards like with all these studies coming out how most

these Foods has not been banned because of the Agricultural laundry right that you know I mean just we talked about Pop-Tarts and how bad they are but they're you know we're spending government money to give them to poor children which will keep them poor that's so sad I find that's the hardest part for me where I'm like but we can change it yeah I know we can that smart people can figure out solutions to yeah dramatically shift the population I don't know if we ever talked about The Daniel Plan the big project I did

Saddleback Church you know thousands of churches have done the health program that I created with Pastor Rick Warren so you just have to have intention yeah absolutely there's lots of purpose that's part of the revolution in brain health yeah Fifth and final question what makes you happier being here makes me happier seeing you being with people I love makes me happier from I was at the Beverly Hilton Hotel today getting ready for our event and they cooked a lot of Tana's recipes from her cookbook the brand Warriors way and they

did such an amazing job that made me happy and I'm walking out to the parking lot someone recognized me so I love your Tick Tock of all things so making a difference yeah makes me happy I'm one of seven children and I'm in the middle so I was completely irrelevant and so not being irrelevant sort of helps make me happy I love that uh Dr John Eamon it's always such a joy to spend time with you honestly it really is and thank you so much for all the work you're doing I I know I lean on it constantly
