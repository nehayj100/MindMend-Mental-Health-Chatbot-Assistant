 So rather than focusing on running a four minute mile or being able to bench press a certain weight, start with goals that are just about kind of to borrow the old Nike, just doing it. You start with the process of, okay, I'm going to do some form of exercise at physical activity three times a week for 20 minutes today and just use that. So think about what's going to be the result of an outcome of that. And once you start to master those, then you can start shifting toward setting some performance or outcome base goals for yourself because then you're going to have a better framework of what is truly achievable for you. You're listening to Inside Mental Health, a psych central podcast where experts share experiences and the latest thinking on mental health and psychology. Here's your host Gabe Howard. Hey everybody, welcome to the show. I'm your host Gabe Howard. This podcast is sponsored by cornbreadhemp.com, save 30% on your first order using code inside 30. Calling into the show today, we have Cedric Bryant. Dr. Bryant earned both his doctorate in physiology and a master's degree in exercise science from Pennsylvania State University. He is the CEO of the American Council on Exercise Ace, which is the leading nonprofit organization certifying health coaches and exercise professionals. Dr. Bryant, welcome to the podcast. Well, thanks, Gabe. Well, I am super excited that you're here now. The first thing I want to say is this is a mental health show. So we don't usually have people who are certifying exercise folks, you know, physical therapists and things like that. Exercise is not something that we talk about a lot because we spend all of our time on mental health. But when you reached out to us and we started talking about this show, you correctly pointed out that in your organization correctly pointed out that, you know, your physical health does drive your mental health and that's something that doesn't get a lot of conversation. Now I have always said that mental health and physical health shouldn't be separated and then of course I was separating it on the podcast. So the first question I wanted to ask you is do you see it from your side where people are always talking about physical health, but they're not talking about their mental health? Yeah, I think both sides of that coin are true in that. Those in the exercise world and the physical activity space tend to sometimes become myopically focused on the body elements, but not the mind elements. You might have certain disciplines like yoga and Pilates where they talk quite frequently about the mind body connection, but in traditional exercise, there tends to be an over focus on many of the physical aspects. But one of the hidden blessings of the COVID pandemic is that people gained a greater appreciation for that mind body connection and for mental health. Because one of the things that used to always be the number one reason why individuals would seek out exercise professionals and look to become more physically active was to lose weight or approve their physical appearance and that's really changed quite dramatically after the pandemic and that I think dealing with the stress of the pandemic, dealing with the isolation associated with the pandemic, many people are placing more emphasis and importance on their mental health. I think one of the underappreciated values and benefits of being physically active is that it has such a profoundly positive impact on our mood, on our attitudes, on how we handle the stress of life. I mean, there is not a single person on this planet who isn't exposed to some level of stress throughout their day and exercise and being physically active can help us to better manage that. I mean, you really can spell stress relief with exercise. And so to your point is that if I'm handling my stress better, if my mood is elevated, which we know that exercise can have some mood altering positive effects, that I'm going to be a better me. I'm going to feel better about all of me to include the physical me, if the mental me of me is well. And so it definitely, the two are linked and that's why you can't separate the mind from the body. Now, I've noticed from my vantage point, lots of trends in the industry. Do this exercise, do this diet, take this vitamin, take this supplement, do this one thing, and seemingly overnight, you will be the peak of physical fitness. Is that true? Is there, tell it? I want it to be true, Dr. Bryant. I want you to tell me the thing that I can do so that tomorrow I will have six pack abs and be able to climb up and down ladders and stairs without losing my breath. It exists, right? Gabe, I wish I could tell you that. I think we all would love that. It would be nice if we could get those results that we're seeking without any effort. And I think that's why there's such a strong appeal to many of these fat, tight, fitness approaches in that they promise the impossible. They promise that you can get the body you want. You can get the level of physical functioning and capability that you want with little or no effort. And you can get it at the snap of a finger. And unfortunately, the human body just doesn't work that way. And it is a process and it takes time. And I think one of the things that we have to balance out is that natural kind of impatience that we have, that we want that immediate success with the realities that is going to take some time. So we've got to figure out how do we help individuals find ways to identify the early success, if you will, that will kind of keep them in the game until they kind of start to experience those long-term results that they're really looking for. I completely understand why we want it to be quick. I think we all do. I just want to acknowledge that for the audience. I mean, nobody wants to take a painstaking process, right? If you can do something and get good results quickly, we want to do it. But over the years, I mean, quick fix after quick fix after quick fix has come. It gets all of the attention and it fails. It goes away. And yet, like Moth to a Flame, people are attracted to the next one. Why are we so attracted to these quick fixes? Why do we not just see them as BS? Why are they still catching fire and catching our attention? Why is America not just ignoring these fads? I believe it's in part, Gabe, is that many of the marketers of those quick fixes and those products and so forth are quite clever. And they really know how to touch the right buttons for many people who have experienced a great deal of frustration and they're bored of lying desperate to find something that works. You already have someone who you can mildly manipulate because they're really hungry for something that's going to work for them. And then when you can show them great testimonies, you can do the stage before and after pictures and you can show, you have all the social media now, you can get the kind of echo chamber that is just bombarding you with these messages that look at this. It just worked for this person, that person and they did it with little effort and overnight and look at how they look now. And so it just feeds into that desire that folks have to really experience that change with ease and convenience and lack of discomfort. And that's one of the challenges with physical activities that if we're honest, physical activity for most people and I say most people greater than 80% of the population doesn't find it enjoyable because it's not enjoyable. And that's something that I think people in our space sometimes have a hard time relating to because for us personally, we love it. I love being physically active, but I also have to be cognizant of the fact that most of the people that I'm going to be working with trying to help don't share that same thought and have had that same experience. And so for them, you've got to find the thing that is going to work for them, the thing that's going to kind of float their boat, that's going to get them started. And I think what happens sometimes in our space is that because we are so locked into our belief that it's such a great thing and that we tend to be so prescriptive and we forget about the kind of intangible side of thing of really finding that something that people can find some level of enjoyment in doing. And even if it isn't the ideal exercise, if it can get them started on that journey, and I like to think of it as a journey because with the journey, you're going to have some missteps and help the person prepare for that and recognize that it isn't going to be the straight line success. There are going to be a lot of missteps along the way, but just keep seeking for a little bit of progress. And I think too often we seek perfection as opposed to those small steps of progress. There's two things I want to say to that. One, I completely agree. I think to myself all the time, well, I don't have time to go for an hour walk. So therefore, I'm going to go for a zero minute walk. And study after study after study is like, you know, Gabe, if you went for a 10 minute walk, you would be so much better off. But I'm like, 10 minutes is nothing. I'm not going to look good after 10 minutes, but I would benefit from a 10 minute walk. I just want to put that out there. But I want to back up to something that you said it to be sure of your answer, where you said it's easy to manipulate vulnerable people with stage before and after photos. I think that the average person doesn't realize that they can be staged or that there is a way to manipulate it. The testimonies may lack context. Can you share with our audience some of the things that they should look out for when they're evaluating a workout system or an exercise program that they see online or on television that's being promoted? Sure. One of the things, really, that old ad is that if it sounds too good to be true, it probably is the thing that you need to look at is look at the claims that they're making and what is the real solid, independently verified support for those claims. If a product is relying almost exclusively on testimonials as opposed to real solid research evidence, that would cause me to be a little suspicious. If they really rely quite heavily on celebrity, social media influencers, and you look at also the credentials of some of the individuals who are promoting these things. What are their backgrounds? Do they have a direct financial tie to that product? Really, if you can just let your sniff meter just trust it, because I think most people kind of know, but again, it's that tough spot where you're so desperate and so wanting to find that secret bullet, that magic bullet, that people ignore their sniff meter. I completely agree with everything that you said. If it's too good to be true, it probably is, or everybody would just be perfect. Everybody would have all the energy they wanted. Everybody would have the bodies that they wanted. Everybody would have the strength levels they wanted. It would just be perfect. The very proof of it is that it's not. One of the things that you said, and I want to play a little bit of devil's advocate here, you said, trust the science. Trust the science. Don't rely on celebrities, listen to science. Science has presented us a problem in the exercise space. I remember I'm almost 50 years old, and when I was a kid's sit-ups were all the rage. Do sit-ups, do sit-ups, do sit-ups, do sit-ups, do sit-ups. This was science pounded this into my head. Then one day they're like, you know what, sit-ups are probably bad for your back. It's causing back pains. Don't do sit-ups anymore. Science is now saying that sit-ups were bad. I can do this all day. We're eggs. I don't even know where eggs are on the spectrum right now, but they have been bad because they have high cholesterol. They have been good because I don't even know why. Science, of course, is changing as research becomes available. I think the average person is like, well, I can't even count on science because even science is wrong. At least the celebrities, they're really packaging this in a way that I love to hear. What is your response to the, well, can we trust the science? One of the things is that I think there's a misconception of what really good science looks like, in that good science shouldn't remain static. Because as new evidence becomes available, good science should change and adapt according to that new evidence. That's why you will see things like what you, your example, with sit-ups and eggs and so forth. To me, that's good science. That we're evolving, that we're changing as the information becomes available. I think people want to have science to tell me the answer, and this is 100% what I can trust and it never changes. That's not science. That's dogma. I think that's what people need to understand is that with good science, you're going to have things that are going to change and evolve, and that is tough for the average person to understand and appreciate. Over the mental health space, we see a lot of marketing to very vulnerable people who want that quick fix. In fact, they're desperate for a quick fix because they're so sick. When I think about schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, major depression, and of course, suicidality, I understand why they're so desperate. Why are they so desperate on the physical health side? I understand that we all want to look better and have more energy, but there just seems to be a component at least from my perspective that's missing. Why are people so desperate to believe in this quick fix? When we have the answer, a good diet, moderate exercise, making some healthy choices, and we're going to be okay. It seems so simple yet everybody's attracted to this over and over and over again. We see it time and time and time again. Where's the desperation coming from? Well, because it sounds simple, Gabe. Follow a sensible eating plan, get regular activity, get good rest, manage your stress. All those things sound simple, but they're very, very challenging and it really comes down to behavior change science. Most of us have ambivalence toward change.

And we're back discussing why people are attracted to quick fixes of diet and exercise fats with the CEO of the American Council on Exercise, Dr. Cedric Bryant. Most people hate change. And changing one's lifestyle is monumentally difficult. And that's why it really does require, you know, the old takes a village. It requires that that support, support from family members, trusted friends, from professionals to help you to make those small, important changes that add up over time to allowing you to follow that sense of waiting plan to be regularly active. So those things sound simple, but they're very, very, very challenging. And most of us can't effectively navigate that on our own. What I'm about to say is a bit reductive. And I understand that. But, you know, eating well and exercising a little bit and just sort of maintaining our health, just a little bit does pay big dividends. But it also kind of sounds like a quick fix to me, right? Just do the very bare minimum and you'll be okay. Now, I know that the flashy media, etc. offers much better, right? You've got a bodybuilder's body. You're able to do one arm pull-ups. But that's not reasonable for most people. Do you think that the average American public understands that the average person just can't do one arm pull-ups? They're not going to behave like professional athletes. And also not for nothing. A 50-year-old is not going to behave like a 20-year-old no matter how hard they try for the average person. Do you think there's that understanding? Or there isn't. So far gone. No, there isn't. I think you're hitting on a very important point. And that's one reason why these approaches really need to be more personalized and individualized. Because what is a realistic expectation for me as a 60-year-old compared to my sons who are in their 20s aren't the same. In their 20s and 30s, they're younger. They have different abilities. But that's one of the challenges that we have is that most people aren't content with what they realistically can achieve. Most of us tend to be more aspirational. And we look at those images that we see that are the pictures of health and fitness in those pictures aren't diverse enough, in my opinion. Because you don't have to look like a donus to really have a good level of health and fitness. But that's the misperception that continually gets portrayed. And that's why the average person feels like, why am I going to exercise for 10 or 15 minutes and eat a little better and not see washboard abs and not be able to bench press whatever that weight is or whatever it might be. Because we have these unrealistic expectations that have been so consistently and pervasively marketed to us that we see that as being the goal when it really isn't. But shouldn't be. I agree with you. I really, really do. I don't have washboard abs. I don't have a six pack. You do though, Gabe. I do have a six pack. You have a six pack. The problem for most of us is it's covered with some layers of subcutaneous fat. So they're incognito. They're incognito. I like that. I like that. Okay. I don't have a visible six pack. Thank you for that. Now I feel I want you to hear it first, Dr. Brian. I'm telling my wife I have a six pack. The minute she walks in the door. You can go tell her. Just can't see it, honey, but it's under there. And I think that's a healthy way to look at it though. Thank you for bringing that up. But what I'm thinking about is that most people don't have a six pack. Just a visible six pack, right? I mean, I'm in the locker room. I'm in the gym. I'm hanging out. I'm doing all this stuff. And I'm just not seeing this body that we think is the correct body. The body that I'm seeing, I got to tell you, it looks a lot like mine. Right? I'm a little bit overweight, but not a lot. I used to be a lot overweight and I've done a lot of diet and exercise to get down to this. I do want to disclose that. But I would say I have a very stereotypical body. You know, some parts jiggle that I wish didn't, but they do. I don't have solid muscle definition. But look, I can go on a 10 mile hike at almost 50 years old. No problem. I'm going to call that a win, right? I'm enjoying my life and I can move around. That's a huge, a huge win. But many people looking at me would be like, I don't know, dude. I think you need, I think you need the quick fix. I think you need the six pack. I think you need the gym, the diet. It's just, it's pummeled at me that I'm doing something wrong. And I'm not quite sure that I see it, but I tell you, I do want to look like the rock. I do. Oh no. And that's that aspirational aspect that I'm talking about. But I do think we have to reframe our definitions of what's an ideal body weight, what's, what is success? What is that win? And I tell people when I'm working with them, I ask them a couple of questions. Do you have any type of health related and medical condition that is negatively being impacted by your current level of weight? And the answer to that is no. Okay, that's good. Check. Are you able to do the things in life that you need to and want to do physically? Check. And are there things that your weight is causing you to feel with regard to yourself from a emotional or psychological perspective? And at the answer to that is no. Then you are probably pretty close to a pretty effective ideal weight for yourself. I think too often we're so focused on the images, the scale, and not the kind of why I want to be at a certain weight. And the why should really be about being able to live the fullness of life as you define it and not face upon some images that you're being bombarded with. Going back to where all of this can be very confusing. Of course, science tells us about that BMI chart. There's calculators all over the internet where I enter my height, my age, my gender. Maybe there's a couple of other questions thrown in. And it tells me how much I should weigh. And if I don't weigh in between those numbers, it's a real problem for me. And I want to let you in the audience know, I don't weigh in between those numbers. I am considered obese by that scale. Yet, I do feel okay. So now, should I use the science to tell me that I need to go on a diet, get a better exercise routine, lose weight? I think that is where people struggle. Because even when they get away from the glitz and glamour of the quick fixes, they're still being told almost constantly that we're too heavy or that we have this problem or that something is too high, too wrong, too broken, need to fix it. And well, I do think that leaves us vulnerable. What are your thoughts on that? I gave them. I'm loving your questions. Because actually the BMI is an example of that kind of evolution of the science is a great example in that BMI is actually really falling out of favor. Because BMI's greatest role is being able to, on a large population scale, it's a very simple tool to use. But in terms of defining whether or not you gave are at an acceptable weight, BMI is terribly ineffective. And many in the medical and health communities are starting to recognize and accept that reality and really aren't using things like BMI as that way of defining whether or not one is at an acceptable weight. It's really been used for years, really kind of that large population scale, but from an individual basis, it's terribly ineffective. You are absolutely right. And I know you're not surprised that you're right, but yeah, the BMI is falling out of favor in the science community, the medical community. And I'm just curious, is the reason that the general public doesn't know this is because the BMI is pushed by the quick fix people? Because that's where I'm really seeing it the most. Whenever there's a quick fix, a new diet, a new exercise program, the thing that's going to make you look like the rock in under 20 minutes, you know, start this diet on Wednesday and have a beach body on Saturday, right? They always promote the BMI chart. It seems to be everywhere. Is this one of the reasons that we can't get rid of it because science just doesn't have the budget to tell people that it's no longer used, but the people who want you to feel overweight, who want you to feel less than they're still promoting it? Is that the cycle we're stuck in? I think that as part of the issue and contributes, but I think a big part, and you alluded to it, is that the science community doesn't have the budget to really bring forth the messaging, but I think it's more than I think the science community doesn't have the expertise to really effectively message and market the things that we know to be true. And I think exercise is a great example in that if you think about all the things, the wonderful things that exercise can do for someone, we have done a pretty miserable job of selling a great product. And I think what the scientific community needs to understand is that we really need to engage folks who are expert in marketing to help us with our messaging because our messaging doesn't connect with and resonate with real people. Dr. Bryant, we're almost at a time and we've talked about a lot of things that don't work. We've talked about a lot of things to avoid. I do want to spend just a moment to steer our audience into what they should pay attention to and what does work. If somebody's listening right now and they're like, okay, you've convinced me the quick fixes aren't going to work, what should I do instead? I know we've alluded to it a little bit here, but can you break it down for our audience? What works versus what doesn't? I think first and foremost, this setting realistic goals. Finding something that's achievable may have a little stretch to it, but also make sure that that goal, think about the larger reason behind the goal. Why do I want to achieve X? Because I think really finding that Y will give you a much greater level of motivation to hang in there when it gets tough. I'd say start low and go slow. It really needs to be that approach where you're starting out an acceptable level because what happens to a lot of people is that they go from zero to 60 and they get so aggressive and they experience all that delayed muscle soreness and they say, this just confirms everything I thought about exercise. It's things. It's painful. It's unpleasant. If you can start low and go slow, you can gradually build up to it. You don't experience that awful feeling that many people do. Find people that you can surround yourself with who are going to help to encourage and reinforce the changes that you're trying to make. Sometimes that might require that you solicit expert advice as well. I think most of all is to be patient with yourself and give yourself some grace because it's not going to happen overnight and it's not going to happen without a few steps back as you're stepping forward. I was telling people, don't seek out perfection, seek out consistent progress. Over time, you're going to be happy with where you land in that journey. It really sounds like the old-added, slow and steady wins the race. Absolutely. Of course, it's a race, which is exercise. It is. But I tell you what, it is a race that you get a magnificent reward when you finish that race. I love that. Dr. Brian, thank you so much for being here. Now, you are with the American Council on Exercise or ACE. Can you tell our listeners where to find ACE a little bit about the organization and any information that they need? Sure. You can find us at ACE Fitness.org is our website. We are a nonprofit organization with a simple mission to get people moving. I think because of our name having exercise in it, many people mistakenly think of it as being single-ly focused on exercise as physical activity. But I like to think of it as getting people moving toward adopting and maintaining healthy lifestyle. That includes nutrition, sleep, stress management, exercise. It's really about starting that journey and getting people to stick with that journey. Dr. Brian, thank you so much and a great big thank you to all of our listeners.
