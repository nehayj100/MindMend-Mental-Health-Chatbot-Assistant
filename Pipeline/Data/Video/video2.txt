you win some you lose some but you live you live to fight another 
day it doesn't matter how hard you work I'm willing to work harder than you no 
one will outwork me no one be the guy who Embraces hard work 
the grind don't be afraid of being hurt don't be afraid of a shacking Fess in some blood some of us don't make excuses 
some of us don't surrender some of us don't give up give me it go do something that's hard if you want it you got to go 
get it most people don't want it that badly it's time to unwrap the potential 
you can be superior man it's within you no one 
said it was supposed to be easy Some People Want it 
easy but I dare you to go the hard way I know what that feels like to be 
left for dead after you gave make me you have I just believe in me and um I'm 
going to overcome all my adversity they will not see you coming 
as you rise as you work every single day 
tiously in order to achieve greatness you must first believe you care if you 
want to be good at something you want to accomplish something you've got to put in the 
time so right now I need you to find a way to keep on living my friend I need 
you to live I need you to live I need you to live do you hear 
me there's no excuse not to be the hardest mothering worker in the room 
life is going to be hard and you're going to fail and you're going to fail and you're going to fail 
and you're going to fail and you're going to fail and then you're going to win you're 
going in again and this time you're coming out with a 
win if it's lifegiving if it's serving your purpose if it's going to transform 
you into something you never thought you could be then do it 
again I'm thankful to see another day no things aren't what I want them to 
be no I don't have all the things I want to have but I'm thankful that I'm still 
here I have another opportunity another another day to live 
another chance to contribute another chance to make a difference in 
life it is ridiculously impossible to become a human being I am one I have 
other good things going for me as a human being and I'm just grateful you you're dwelling and looking at what you 
don't have versus looking at what you have you are 
alive against stupendous odds 
you are breathing air observing sunsets gazing into the night 
sky most people who could exist will never experience 
that I need to constantly remind 
myself I'm not yet where I want to be but I know I'll get 
there I'm not where I want to be but I am 
grateful I am so grateful that I'm not where I used to 
be I find 10 things to be grateful for before my feet hit the ground 10 things and they can't cost 
money and especially if I'm feeling strained and stressed I go over my gratitude's list cuz gratitude will 
reduce stress all day long happiness only requires that you 
are grateful if you've got a billion dollars and three beautiful children that love you and a beautiful husband or 
wife but doesn't matter what you have if you're not grateful if you live in an emotional home a habitual pace of worry 
or frustration your life's called worry and frustration perspective and once you see gratitude 
and opportunity life is fun you get to decide if you're going to dwell and play prevent defense or if you're going to 
see opportunity and be grateful and go on offense I am not where I want to be but 
I am so grateful I am not where I used to be if you didn't make me you can't 
break me if you didn't make the sun come up you can't stop me if you didn't make the moon shine at night you can't stop 
me my purpose my will my dedication my motivation is all about doing the 
business because guess what ladies and gentlemen that's what I'm about I'm about that business I'm about that life 
you have to stay grateful you can't take things for granted we have so much abundance in the world so much 
opportunity and too many people are crying about what they don't 
have instead of being so deeply grateful for what they have do all you can within your power 
and the power of others who love you to maximize what you can be what you can 
think what you can learn how you can love whatever it is that's what you've 
got use it 
I got one question to ask you can you do this thing alone I've trained 99% of my life 
alone no one Pat me on the back I did all of the work 
alone wolves don't lose sleep over the opinions of a lesser 
species be alone go to that dark space you may not want to fight that 
battle but you need to a beast is someone who can go through 
hell and be grateful that their legs are working what are you are you a sheep or 
are you a wolf when you train alone I can take 
myself to such a level of real real passion and 
purpose nobody's going to feed us you got to feed yourself the feeling I get is something I can't 
even exp I don't need anyone it's on you you got to want it as 
bad as you want to breathe success starts with you it's all on you if you want to be 
strong you got to learn to fight alone yes you're tired yes your mind is 
saying give up yes it's saying quit but you cannot quit because you realize you have not reached the goal yet 
day in and day out you got to keep on working and if you're get knocked down so what rise up and get 
up nobody's going to believe in you until you've already done it nobody's 
going to come and celebrate with you until you've already done it which means you're going to have to work for a long 
time by yourself with no applause with no awards no one's going to believe in you in the beginning nor should they be 
okay with it if I have to do it alone I 
will start alone but get 
started this is your day get up and Conquer your day he tell you something about 
self-doubt you have to conquer it if you let self-doubt rule your decisions 
you'll never get anywhere if you don't believe in yourself nobody will so be bold be relentless and never let anyone 
stand in your way this is my day to read a new book this is my day to start a journey this is my 
day to make an investment this is my day to invest in myself this is my day and 
this is my time and it's my turn this is the day I take it seriously 
I got one window I may not be here tomorrow the biggest regret of the dying 
is never becoming your ideal self you got to focus on conquering 
today this is the moment the Moment of Truth for 
you to understand that within you there are great 
possibilities it all starts the moment you take responsibility and say to yourself nothing is going to shake my 
destiny but me you will go through things and while you're going through them you can't understand why it's 
happening to you but but after you go through it you get back and you look at it then you say 
oh now I understand why I needed that lesson then I saw that that was 
preparing me for bigger and better things you still have time don't quit 
don't give up you still have time you can do it you can make it happen but you can't do it procrastinating you can't do 
it talking about it right but there's a total different feeling when you accomplish stuff you got a different level of credibility for people people 
see you different people are willing do things for you that they've never done before people you have credibility that you never had before and so I encourage 
you I encourage you follow through I got the trust that I am someone that 
somebody believes in you got to believe that you got to stand on your faith you 
got to stand on your strength you got to stand on who you are 
take back control of your life stop being a victim stop letting life push you around and start fighting back cuz 
the minute you tell yourself that you control this is the minute you can start to change it I made my last excuse 
yesterday my last reason I came up with my last reason yesterday of why I can't do what I'm supposed to do this is your 
day you've got a window you've got another 24 hours another opportunity to 
forgive somebody another opportunity to let it go another opportunity to look up 
and get up I'm just wondering when are you going to seize the 
opportunity you are worthy you're 
worthy life my friends it's a test of your 
grit your determination when things get tough and 
trust me it will you got to remember one thing it's not how hard you 
hit it's how hard you can get hit and keep moving forward you see Rocky B Bo 
he said that these words stuck with him because life ain't just about the 
victories it's about the battles you fought to get there it's about the 
failures the echo of the daughters that didn't have the perseverance to keep chasing the 
dreams that they wanted so they told you to stop chasing yours but we're not 
going to listen to The Echoes of the doubters we're going to listen to our soul we're going to listen to The 
Warrior that lives inside of us all that tells us it's not about our 
circumstances it's about our opportunities and not just about those opportunities it's about seizing those 
opportunities every chance you get because ladies and gentlemen I got to tell you that these opportunities are 
not going to come back around do you have what it takes to make it through this journey I'm telling you 
young king keep fighting because your life depends on it today we're going to 
reach for the dreams where they said we couldn't reach them it's your job to 
rise like the Phoenix and show the world what you have to offer be the guy 
who Embraces the ugly the miserable 
um be the guy who Embraces hard work the grind don't be afraid of being hurt 
don't be afraid of a sh fast in some blood it's the moments in life the decisions you make on a on on a moment 
to moment basis that add up to be the guy or not the guy tonight I did 
something you know that I feel more of a guy for me who I am my guy make the hard 
decisions make the sacrifices make the unpopular decisions and become 
comfortable in your own skin and if you are not a person that you are comfortable being alone 
with that is the one person in this universe that you have full power full 
right full responsibility to change if you had to create a human what would you put them through to make them 
tough it probably wouldn't be a really chill life what would you put them through to make them patient you 
probably wouldn't give them things immediately and so it's like we want these traits but each of the traits has a 
price tag attached to it and it's just like do you want to pay the price T to get the thing and so I think if if people reframe the the period of life 
that they're going through as the price that they're paying out of their wallet but the wallet is their time is the seconds of life that they're trading for 
it then I think more people will be willing to make the trade because at least when I look at myself like when I'm 80 something years old and I'm 
looking back in my life I want to have these traits but in order to have those traits I know I have to go through these things and I think for me that's given 
me a lot of comfort in hard times right now in life 
your family is looking for that one guy right now they're looking for that one guy who's strong who's that pillar for 
the family in hard times make sure when they look around they look around and 
find you these are the times right now for you to step up be that guy that can take anything stay hard the biggest 
regret of the dying is never becoming your ideal self I do believe that we're 
thrust in a world that we don't fit in and I believe the journey is that a 
lot of people sell you bill of goods along the way that if you get some awards you mean 
something you go to a certain school you got it you're 
cute classical Beauty you got the right man you got the right zip 
code and you swim through all all that filthy swill until you come to the 
really really Stark conclusion that I want to leave this 
earth becoming who I know deep within I 
I am supposed to be the next time you want to just give in that desire for 
Comfort remember that your future self is going to be the one to suffer the consequences so easy to just put it off 
and act like it doesn't exist but that future self that you're passing all these burdens to will one day be 
yourself of the present and you'll wish you chose to do otherwise everything that you do counts 
the biggest mistake that people make is they think that only what they want to count counts no when you read a book 
when you listen to an audio program when you go to a course when you go to bed early and get up early and you work it 
all counts never [ __ ] apologize for being yourself if people don't like how you act how you look how you speak that 
just means those aren't youring people don't change who you are to match your surroundings pick bettering surroundings 
and be yourself and I don't know most men would understand that when a man cries and he's whimpering he's hurting 
you know cuz I've been there and there's no shame in crying gentlemen men it's 
okay to cry we can still be a man but you're also human and it does show a little bit of your vulnerability do it 
for your loved ones do it for your wife wife do it for your husband do it for your children do it for generations to 
come come on after you're dead and gone what will they say about what you did 
yes there's so many people depending on you but it's got to start with you and 
the man upstairs if you want to be great oh man 
prepare to get up off that mat you're going to get knocked down over and over 
and over and even when you feel like no no body it I can't be hit this hard or 
if you're down there thinking there's no way I can get up from this that's when you're just 
starting for some strange reason this world wants to see you water down the 
reality of who you are our society wants to see you think like everyone else and 
feel just like those around you maybe for somebody who's so 
distracted from their true desires as a person that doesn't sound so bad but the 
pain of seeing through limitation in full absence of 
distractions is almost unbearable you see it hurts because the 
resistance wants you to give in and mold to what's expected of 
you and if I can provide some advice don't 
I don't know where you are in your game of life you may be in your third quarter 
you may be in your fourth quarter come on you're not going to live forever not in this world come on you may be in your 
first quarter your your second half and this time it's got to be personal see last time you were just running through 
the plays last time you were just running the songs that you rehearsed in rehearsal last time you were just going 
through the emotions and you got numb come on and you got tired and weary and now you're broken and bitter and angry 
angry cuz you lost and I'm just wondering if you're courageous enough bold enough if you have enough Faith 
come on if you have enough inside of you resilience to come back to the scene his 
life is Relentless you better keep coming back from all your failures all your doubts 
all your [ __ ] you better keep fighting keep getting up never [ __ ] lay down for [ __ ] that's one thing we should all 
agree on if you've been broken one you know how that [ __ ] feels that means 
[ __ ] it try and break me again you got a lot of people playing their hard earn money to come watch you perform perform 
perform it's your job to be in shape it's your job to be strong enough to perform at that level every single night 
and as a competitor I'm not I'm not ducking like it's not oh my God my back 
hurts I'm sore we got to play Vince Carter and Toronto Raptors tonight pick your Mountain whatever that mountain is 
is and each Journey up the mountain is million steps and each day you have to take that step yeah each day you take 
that step you look up at the mountain you say that's where I want to go and then each next day you take your step over 
and over and over again everything was done to try to learn how to become a better basketball player everything 
everything and so when you have that point of view then literally the world becomes your library to help you to 
become better at your craft Let Yourself Go fall free into it step into it you 
are worthy you are an unrepeatable miracle and there is none like you in all the Earth there will never be another you your DNA your fingerprint 
come on your gate your presence your authenticity come on you're special you're special and you're 
necessary nothing changes if nothing changes man in order for something to change 
there needs to be change they say well I'm afraid to make a change I'd say that's okay that's 
understandable how afraid are you of not making a change let's make a little vision of 
that you're 35 you hate your job what's the consequence you're not motivated you 
don't want to get out of bed in the morning you're starting to get depressed you're getting bitter you're getting resentful you're getting cynical you're 
amotivated at work you're not doing a very good job and you're starting to 
shrink now play that out for 10 years you don't change it you don't fix 
it and what happens you're going to be in the same situation but 10 years older and if you 
can't get out of that situation now what the hell makes you think you're going to get out of it in 10 
years you're only seeing what's in front of you you're not seeing what's above 
you I can't change the beginning but could I change the middle could I change can I edit that story rewrite that story 
and change my entire life everybody's so crippled by decisions but you never know 
how the other thing worked out let me give you an example let's say you don't go to college and you start this 
business and you were 100% right and it's huge and you're doing so great but 
because you did that you had to fly to America for a big meeting and your plane 
crashed and you died that would be a bad idea yeah or you 
think you're going to go to college cuz it's a good experience and you'll meet people you can meet people in a business you're not going to know I think people 
overthink decisions you'll never know what the alternative would have been so just pick one and do it change is 
inevitable and you are either changing for the worse or changing for the better you decide I hope I do not believe in 
you more than you believe in yourself right now listen to me guys the transition is going to be hard I'm not 
going to lie to you go from being on the Block going to be a high school dropout to getting a GED is not the transition 
is not easy so what happens in order for you to go from one level to the next level in order for any man to Transit 
listen to me in order for any woman to transition for any man to transition the thing that they want must be greater 
than the thing they currently have listen to me very closely I didn't come in here to tell you you going to finish school came to ask you what's 
[Music] next I came to ask you what's next for 
me it's the Nobel Prize I always think about other people 
that's going through a tougher life than I am what if I had to change 
places would I trade places you know there's something I would always say to people from time to time if I could take 
out a piece of paper and write down my problems and you could take out a piece 
of paper and write down your problems and we exchanged those papers and I'm 
thinking I got such a tough tough life and you may have a tough life but I pick 
up your paper the one you may have written on and I'm looking like wow I thought I had it 
bad and then the other person say hey you got it a lot better than I do you know what I would do I would say give me 
me a Pap give me my paper back I'll take my problems back the point that I'm saying is this I 
didn't put myself in such a pity party position to where I felt why me why not 
me why shouldn't I go through this see you have to know and I believe this even 
more there can never be anything good unless there's some bad along the way 
there has to be a challenge there has to be a struggle there has to be some setbacks you cannot think in your mind 
that that's all you're good for is the good things how good are you when you at your 
weakest point in your life where are you when you're at the down lad of your life then what do you do you are either 
going to evolve or expire see everything changes the economy changes 
relationships changes we change mentally and emotionally and physically and you 
are either dying or you are either living a different person than I was this morning when I woke up the initial 
reaction would be I'm not it's only been like 12 hours how could I be different but if I really think about it what do I 
now know that I didn't know before um what you know what experiences have I 
had that my prior self hadn't had when I had just woken up and if I actually think about it just like gratitude I'm 
creating the frame of my past I actually can and do see that I am different than 
my past self even 12 13 hours ago or the night before and by appreciating that I 
now acknowledge that I've changed which increases my psychological flexibility it allows me to see that I am not the 
same person that I am growing that I am evolving which is really useful for then thinking of your future self as a 
different person you you don't know like like there is no there's no time machine 
there's no future machine we're all overanalyzing everything like how do you know you 
don't like this is why I keep trying to push people the only thing that I know seems practical is are you happy are you 
happy today feels like it's the right thing are you like this is important it's you you can't analyze like I didn't 
know that starting a YouTube show for my wine business was going to be the reason that I was going to have a huge investing career I couldn't see that 
this 30 seconds is your life passing you by an opportunity to change it's your 
prerogative you want to go down the path you have right now of your life and where it's going would 
do you see an alternate path that's not Flatline a clowning up an estron of 
membrance a possibility where dreams exist Legacy exist the possibility of 
change so within the grasp these hand within the graas of 30 seconds it's 
within you you had the will you're here I know you have the will you have the intestinal fortitude you have the want 
of change you only live once so do what you feel passionate about take chances 
don't be afraid to fail how do you know true strength when you never tasted your 
WS when you never was down on your luck when you were at the 
bottom I had to ask myself something and I realize you got to go 
through this hell man this is it cuz as long as you living you got to keep 
moving it don't stop starts with a thought but changing your thoughts is easy it's free can be instant what's the 
point of making it complicated how does that help anyone who says well I'm messed up and so hard to change and 
people can't change it's like well that's not correct who taught you that you from the minute you're born you're 
changing oh you know it's it's long and arduous to recover no it isn't some 
people recover like that some people don't but you could be one of the ones that change changes your thoughts 
changes your feelings changes your actions after all when do you experience 
the positive emotion that's associated with happiness the answer is not when 
you've attained a goal but when you're pursuing one don't you realize excuses 
will kill you it will destroy your well-being and the more excuses you make 
the less effort you're going to give there's a million things I've done wrong it's because I didn't do something that 
would have sent me somewhere else but I have no idea you don't know you don't if 
you do not apply what you hear and it goes over your head you will miss your 
moment nothing changes if nothing changes 
man do it your way you don't need their permission but you need 
yours you don't need their permission but you do need yours you do need to look at yourself and declare who you are 
and you need to believe it you think my dreams are too big I 
said absolutely not you just telling them to the wrong person for some of you the reason why 
you're not taking advantage of this opportunity is not because you don't believe in it you don't believe in 
you in order to achieve greatness you must first believe you 
can cuz I get to decide I'm running my life now I'm finally in control of my 
life I'm finally the boss of my life are you ready to be the boss of your own life are you ready to be in control of 
your own life are you ready and you deserve to have everything 
you want you deserve to live your best life you deserve it and stop listening to the people who tell you you don't 
kill the noise what do they know we going to do the hard work now 
not so here's the hard work I need you to confront 
you I was created to be great I was created to do great things I was created 
to have great things and I will no longer ask others for their 
permission that person who was your hater they thought they defeated you that person who told you you'll never R 
out to anything they thought they defeated you you want me to tell you to give up huh you want me to tell you to 
quit huh that is that what you want me to say is you you want to hear ET say it's all right to give up it's all right 
to surrender that's what you want me to say but listen to me BR I can't tell you that some of us just grind some of us 
don't make excuses some of us don't surrender some of us don't give up and give in it's our Dream nobody's going to 
see it like you do it it's your dream nobody's going to feel it like you feel it it's your dream nobody's going to be 
as dedicated to it as you are it's your dream and they don't have to understand and they don't have to like it and they 
don't have to do it it doesn't make a difference it's your dream and you my 
friend have been given the task to make it happen and you can't let anything stop you from doing what you were called 
to do what we do with the pressure is we say I got to take it I got to take it to 
another level once you start questioning yourself you already lost all of us will 
be successful in life if we don't don't quit I got to believe in me before anybody else believe in 
me I was going to rip his heart out I'm the best ever I'm the most brutal and vicious and most ruthless Champion has

[Music] becoming you know we've been fighting 400 Steel fighting to this day to this

for me it's the equivalent of Maximus desus Meridius and Gladiator picking up 
the dirt smelling the dirt it's go 
time I never underd did things I always overdid things when the war drum sound the 
people that have been to war are the ones that actually say let's think about this first 
because like I said before and like everyone says all the time and they say it like it's no big deal but War as 
[Music] hell before you do that you should think about why you're doing it and understand 
if if the people have the will to fight and 
the will to fight as I've said many times before the will to fight is the will to kill and it's the will to die and those are some pretty big Wills that 
you need to have this is your life my friend and I'm sure when it's all said in done you 
don't want to look back and see that you wasted it this is your life my friend so you stand up this is your life my friend

way I was in it to be 
great out the 100 men that go on war tens sh you [ __ ] be

fighting one is a 
warrior and bodybuilding initially made me have to look at who I am as an 
individual and do I want to do the training okay fine I can train but do I really want to diet do I really want to 
give up time with friends do I want to be 
misunderstood all humans are not created equal some people just have a beautiful

one it's so easy to be great nowadays my friend cuz most people are weak most people don't want to go to that extra 
mile most people don't want to find that extra cuz it sucks of course Talent without work is 
nothing you got got to be hungry people that are hungry are willing to do the 
things today others won't do there's no excuse not to be the 
hardest mothering worker in the room you have to want [Music] 
it and you're going to fail and you're going to fail and you're going to fail 
and you're going to fail and then you're going to 
win and that's life 
life without those challenges it's just 
existence don't just exist go 
live eventually in action will cost you but your default setting should be I'm going to do something just get up move 
towards that challenge and go attack it go do something that's 
hard struggle sucks depends on how you frame 
it if you want freedom in your life you have to have discipline move towards that challenge 
whatever that challenge is and you may be successful and you may not be successful but you will be better and 
the next challenge you're going to be more prepared for because we're going to have wins 
we're going to have losses we're going to have successes we're going to have failures we're going to have good nights 
we're going to have bad nights we're going to have good relationships we're going to have bad relationships we're going to have good ideas and bad ideas 
we're going to make money we're going to lose money all these things are going to happen and if you oscillate emotionally 
up and down drastically it's going to be problematic Embrace those emotions but 
don't let those emotions embrace you keep pushing through things that suck 
this is a very difficult thing to do because it hurts I'm going to go forward I'm not 
going to quit so I'm going to go forward Bring it on I don't care how good you are on 
anything you don't have discipline you Ain nobody cuz you give up under the slightest struggle without 
discipline discipline is doing what you hate to do but do it like you love it 
you may not know this now but you're this close igniting your inner champion and reclaiming your 
destiny it's just that I want to be up more anybody in the planet want me to be down be champion before you become 
champion ion wanting to get the best out of yourself not competing with anyone else but 
you we don't back down from anyone and that's what got me in trouble I don't play games I don't kiss anyone's ass and 
I'm a real man and that's why that's regardless of being a fight anything I'm a man and that's why I want to be a man 
and if I die I want to die a man and when you're really focus you hear 
everything when I come to the ring I noce everybody can hear you breathing I I hear you talking I hear 
everything when I come out I have Supreme confidence I'm scared to death I'm totally afraid I'm afraid of 
everything I'm afraid of losing I'm afraid of being humiliated but I'm totally confident closer I get to the 
ring more confidence I get the closer more confidence I get the closer the more confidence I get but the closer I 
get to the ring I'm more confident once I'm in the ring I'm a God no one could beat me no one to stop 
me the world would know my name till the end of time 
they call me the [Music] greatest because I'm a Savage 
yeah that's who I was I didn't want nothing until I got something and when I said something I 
mean the [Applause] crown you knew from the beginning the 
world was going to know who Mike Tyson was 100% yeah at what age did you know that 14 why why is that because I was 
beating everybody at 
4 more than my skills I had the 
mindset do the kill destroy break them down it's just I'm the 
greatest you know success is all about a lifestyle I live the um lifestyle of the 
champion at 14 in order to be the champion you have to live a life sty of the 
champ it's all about discipline doing what you hate to do but doing it like you love it that's what it's all 
about if you don't have discipline I don't care how skillful you are you're nothing if you want to be the best ever 
while are you here confidence breathes success and 
success breathe confidence it's all about the belief that you can do it belief is more 
powerful than anything only thing we could do is just um have that focus and believe in 
ourself and believe that I want to be up then anybody in the world wants me to be down and it's all about like I said 
before self-belief my whole success um is from 
belief I just believe in me and um I'm going to overcome all my 
adversities the truth uh set you free but it's going to make you Miser first and that's how we improve as a 
person improving ourselves you have to first have the 
aptitude to do what you claim you want to do and if you have that and the determination and the will to win 
there's nothing that you can't do impossible is nothing compared to 
anybody that tries nothing's impossible then confidence breathes success success 
breeds confidence and confidence applied properly will supersede a 
[Music] genius life is just a circle they're going to hate me again one day and then 
God willing they going to respect me again one day because in order to be a master you have to first be a fool I 
guess you have to believe in yourself before you believe in anything else God 
we living you have to believe in you once you believe leaving you and have a relationship with you is nothing that 
you can't do you have to be the 
champion in this to be the champion in 
this when I win the morning I win the day so that's why exercise is important to relieve your 
stress win the morning you win the day and so I I realized life is all 
about in here it's all about your belief system Faith 
fear never lose when you face it trust me never lose when you face 
fear know our mistakes don't Define us our high points don't Define us life 
defines us as long as you can have happy moments take as many of them as you can because 
life is just a flick of the eye well that's what life is about you 
got to you got to sit in your room some time give your subconscious some time and spend time and en and just Envision 
yourself doing being with the most exciting people in the world doing the most exciting things in the world and 
just living that fantasy and that fantasy will become reality one day discipline could be taking your 
Illusions and turning them into a reality you dream of yourself something 
bigger than what you can ever imagine and you become it now that's 
discipline in order to be able to change anything you have to change yourself you 
know you have to look in the mirror say what do I want to do to make me a better person or what is it that I can do that 
could Define myself as being a better person than I am now you know who can I 
help who can I worship who can I do something to or with that would make me 
feel like a better person and help me reach my Highest Potential you have to find that first what do the die can do 
help people you know that's all I think about how can we help 
somebody visualizing looking into the mirror and that's what it's all about touching your inner core of your 
[Music] Consciousness I don't believe in Talent well some people they have talent that's 
it's good it helps when you have talent as long as you have a lot of determination and will power that's all you need and you you have to have the 
will to win I you think anybody with the will will the will to win and desire not to 
lose will succeed I would think of myself as um a roaring Gladiator like Alexander the 
Great I feel like I'm a ruler when I'm in my mind thinking about accomplishing something I think possible nothing's 
impossible to somebody who tries so I never think about failure in that perspective I think about failing but 
not in that perspective I need the pressure without the pressure there's no me without the pressure I don't have the 
guts to to say hey I'mma fight this guy I have to have depression anything that 
I'm afraid to do I do it and um that's just how I live my 
life the more you're comfortable with you the more you be comfortable with death and the more comfortable you are 
with death the more at peace you are with 
yourself I knew never to get discouraged I knew I would get my day if I continue 
to try hard and believe in myself [Music] I am who I am and I'm going to die being 
who I am and I'm going live being who I am this is just who I am it's all about what you believe I got 
belief in myself and belief is more powerful than 
anything life was given for a reason we exist for a 
reason we were put on this Earth to do great things but the 
challenges ladies and gentlemen the challenges had to 
[Music] happen they must happen but we must carry 
on what do we do with the life that has been given how do we face the circumstances 
that have been brought before us do we give up do we stand up 
do we push through those are the questions that we ask each and every day 
when we are faced with adversity no one said it was supposed to 
be easy hard times create tough Mass tough 
Mass creates tough characters but you got to carry 
on so when it gets tough you got to get 
tough we are born to do great 
things not everybody is going to stand with you not everybody's going to support you not everybody's going to be 
by your side so when you're standing 
alone make sure you stand with a pure heart that you do have 
something that you must do learn to walk alone 
sometimes learn to be strong when you need to be strong learn to understand that not 
everybody will be with you I dare you to go down that path that 
many refuse to go I dare you to show up and show the world that you have 
something that is special and unique about you I dare you to show the world 
something they ain't never seen before about you I dare you to stand up I dare you to breathe life to your 
purpose I dare you to do it I dare you to be 
strong I dare you to be a man I dare you to be a woman I dare you to be the one 
that they never even knew existed all you got to do is just stand 
on what you do pain 
passion Focus Faith 
you put it together you will be an Unstoppable 
force not everything you do in life is meant for 
you not everything that you want out of life is designed for you 
but there Comes A Time in your life that you have to just say let's be 
patient let's take the necessary steps let's make a few 
mistakes I'm talking about the mistakes that happen throughout life just to get to a common 
ground accept the challenges but don't give up 
so when you're standing alone make sure you have the right mindset within you to know that hey at 
the end of the day I must stand I must work I must 
believe I will fight I will work I will 
push and I will never quit on me you let the naysayers tell you that you didn't 
have it you let negativity surround you you let doubt and fear control you you 
let excuses kill you now what do you 
do you got to get up stop sleeping on your dreams stop 
sleeping on your desires stop sleeping on your passion 
ladies and gentlemen no one said it was supposed to be 
easy I will make everything count each and every day of my 
life for my life is in my hands and I must be willing to do what I must do to 
get where I need to be in my life hard 
times what do we do how do we get through it do we 
stress or do we take a rest from it do we know how to turn it 
up and do we know how to turn it off you don't know enough about yourself 
because you believed everything negative about you but you didn't have the truth within you you didn't understand that 
you were made for a reason you didn't understand that you had power ladies and gentlemen get out there and fight for 
your life 
what you do right now matters how you pursue your life how you 
go further in your life is what you put inside of your mindset and say I am 
ready I must go forward and if I look back I'm too 
distracted to see what's in front of me do you have to keep 
going but the moment you doubt you step too far back and not 
enough forward you lose you will lose yourself 
because you have given up you will lose yourself and you will never find your way back because you gave up too soon 
you will lose yourself because you didn't think you had it anymore battles are meant to 
fight and you will fight each battle of of your life and some you will win and 
some you will lose but if your heart is beating and your brain is functioning and your eyes are open ladies and 
gentlemen get out there and fight for your life it's 
hard deal with it every day you breathe 
is a chance for you to live every day that you breathe is a chance for you to 
make a difference every day that you Bree breathe is a chance for you to stand up every day that you breathe is a 
chance for you to make a difference within yourself every day that you breathe is an opportunity for you to 
fight every day that you breathe is an opportunity for you to let the world know that you are about your 
business let the hard work begin let the 
testimony be the testimony when you are tested be the testimony when you have 
been pushed back pushed back even harder when you feel that you can't carry on 
feel within yourself that you are alive and you got a job to do it is all 
business never personal be productive be strong be powerful hard work never quit 
and from the bottom of my heart ladies and gentlemen conduct 
your 
business again again again again type it in the chat again again again again 
again if it's life giving if it's serving your purpose if it's going to transform you into something you never 
thought you could be then do it again do it again type it in the chat 
drop it in the comments man again again again again again this thing served me this thing helped me it hurt but it's 
helping me and it's building a bridge to the Future and the destiny that I've been called to fulfill 
period every time you go back you're building muscle You're Building mentality You're Building endurance 
you're establishing faith it takes Faith to get out of this to crawl yourself out 
of a messy history and leave a legacy it is the man that refuses to quit it is 
the man that refuses to put down his gloves that separates winners from one 
of these it is diligence and dedication and determination that separates the all 
time Grace from the one hit wonders do you want to do this thing one time or do you want to be notorious for winning 
over and over and over again I just want to know is anybody 
listening that wants to do it again I don't want to win one time I don't want 
to be noticed one time I Don't Want To Make History one time I want to do it over and over and over again do it again 
no matter how hard it was no matter how much you cried and you sweat and you bled do it 
again again again again again again again again again again 
your goals are posted on your wall you commit privately and publicly to the 
call that's on your life you think about it day and night whatever the goal is 
it's time to shatter the ceiling above your head to break records to shatter 
the status quo to punch through targets it's your time it's your turn you've 
doubted yourself long enough people have left you overlooked you undervalued you underpaid you it's your time to connect 
it's your time to get paid it's your time to sign the deal it's your 
time everybody's great when they not tired this is when they tired that's when the real champions come out that's 
when a real dog come out it's where I think the real truth comes out because I think there are a 
lot of people who are very talented who can make it there there are very few people who can deal with the pressure 
and stress that happens when we're there I feel I'm the best ever it's not bragging AB bosing the proof is in the 
put in my mind I'm always the best I am the greatest spidal of all 
time and when I hit you with a hard right hand you will 
fall you got to win tomorrow you got to win right now if you're passionate about what you're doing keep going keep 
believing Reach for the Stars everything is always impossible until someone does 
it maybe it has never been done before that's perfectly fine with 
me but I'm going to do it never say 
never because limits like fears are often Just an 
Illusion hungry dogs run faster and let the big dogs 
eat if you look at the greats in any Walk of Life the greats do things when they 
don't always want want to and that's the separation it means you have to be more 
disciplined than not disciplined I wanted to be the best I could be 
period I was waiting for you to smile at some of the compliments you didn't she being smiling doesn't when you gold 
medals I'm too fast I'm too skillful and I'm going to show everybody out that watch this show and the whole world and 
the world will vow and admit that I am the greatest of all times when you see what I do to George for 
I believe that whatever I put my mind to and if I was willing to make sacrifices and I was dedicated that I could achieve 
absolutely anything I'm the best ever I'm the most brutal and vicious and most ruthless Champion there ever been 
there's no one can stop me I'd like to take this chance to apologize to absolutely 
nobody maybe someone's don't like me because and maybe I'm too 
good you win some you lose some but you live you live to fight another 
[Music] 
day and I've always believed like I'm to Michael Jordan of this industry when I'm on the air I'm the one that will make 
you want to hear from me I don't care who I'm on the air with I don't care who it is it does not matter to me by the 
time I finish speaking I am the one that you're going to want to listen to that's my 
attitude if this requires 100% And you give me 99 I might want to 
fire you because I'm not I'm about getting the job done it's about the 
results and I think that you know unfortunately when we look at our generation today not enough people 
preach about that because I think that we live in a society where people have become Masters at pointing the finger at 
other people as to reasons why things don't get done I think there's too much explanation that goes 
on but the bottom line is you ain't getting it done and if you're not getting it done I need somebody that can 
get it done I am of the belief that if you truly truly adopt that belief in your 
soul then you walk to work every day not looking for excuses you're looking for a 
way for the job to get done and in most instances you are going to be successful 
not you want to go with status quo you're you're you're perfectly you know fine with flowing along just get along 
safe secure whatever but when you're trying to win you're constantly looking to get 
better My Philosophy is very very simple when it comes to my family particularly 
you know me being a dad if they're hungry it's because I'm starving I don't eat until they eat I 
not comfortable until they comfortable I don't have unless they have that's the 
mentality and that's the mentality that I strictly get from my mother and so for me you know having that kind of 
mentality but what comes with that what comes with that is a certain work ethic that you have to put forth and it's a 
willingness to sacrifice am I the most disciplined person in the world no am I the most meticulous person in the world 
like some people would believe no I'm meticulous enough and I'm disciplined enough but I think the key thing is is 
that the bottom line is everything to me and whatever the bottom line requires is 
what I'm going to do if the bottom line requires an excessive level of discipline I'm going to do it but to me 
it's whatever the moment or the situation demands and it's I'm a bottom 
lines oriented kind of person you don't assume that 
opportunities are waiting for you you know obstacles are standing at every door right 
and so that challenge that you have to embrace and you have to deal with that's hard to deal with when you have achieved 
it you don't work hard to play hard you work hard to have the ability to play 
when you want to that's good there's a difference you handle your responsibilities first and when you work 
hard and you have that sense of Pride it goes right out the window if you utilize 
your efforts in the wrong fashion but when you do what's right and it's based 
off of that effort that you put in then you feel good about it because you took care of your responsibilities then you 
can go play and I was not always confident there's no doubt about that I've always 
had my insecurities uhhuh what I firmly believed in was as it pertained to me 
was that I always worked hard I was never lazy um I was always somebody that 
believed in hard work betting on yourself is believing in 
you knowing who you are what you're worth having an idea about it anyway and 
willing to work towards that to validate that reality that's betting on 
yourself it's your job and if you can't do it you scratch 
claw and even die trying 
we make excuses every day all of us as human beings on far more occasions than not I 
have to speak on the issue of accountability as it pertains to the entire Sports World and when it comes to 
the issue of accountability I get all of that from Mom it happened with ESN when my 
contract wasn't renewed back in 2008 I was sitting at there I was I felt betrayed I felt ticked off my mother let 
me lick my wounds for a couple of days and then she said what could you have done better you sure you didn't do 
anything and I thought about all the stuff I'm like what is she talking about this is just not true this not right I work hard I do this I do that and then I 
started thinking about it yeah I was a pain in the ass I did 
kind of complain a little bit too much but the biggest thing that I remember doing is that I always came to the 
bosses with problems I never came to them with Solutions it was always about the 
problem never the solution and I learned 
when I sat back and reflected on the mistakes that I had made in my career at the time I learned that no boss wants to 
talk to anybody that doesn't have Solutions instead of working around the 
clock trying to figure out what somebody else wants from you good or bad there 
are moments that crystallizes it for you in your mind pay attention and you'll 
see what they are and you'll know what to do accordingly that is what I believe makes 
me the best it's my commitment to Excellence for the collective 
[Music] whole life is going to be hard 
no one said it was supposed to be 
easy life isn't fair sometimes you just got to do it 
[Music] alone what do you do how do you 
live how do we get through it you got to stand up you got to get 
up the path that you have chosen was never designed to be 
easy Some People Want it easy but I dare you to go the hard 
way what do we do with the life that has been given how do we face the circumstances 
that have been brought before us do we give up do we stand up do we 
push through those are the questions that we ask each 
and every day when we are faced with 
adversity Hard Times create tough Mass tough Mass creates tough 
characters but you got to carry on so when it gets tough you got to get 
tougher when you're stand standing on your own two feet and the storm is 
coming in you still got to stand and sometimes you just got to stand 
alone greatness requires work and hard work is how you get it you 
don't give up because it's hard you don't give up because it's 
challenging you don't give up on you let the hard work 
began so when you're standing alone make sure you 
stand with a pure heart with a great mindset because there's no one like you 
there's nothing that can stop you no one can do the things that you do no one can 
stand like you [Music] do you you have to keep 
going you have to be truthful to who you are [Music] 
inside it was never desired to be 
easy don't give up go for 
it the question is how hungry are 
you how much are you willing to give of your yourself because it's really ultimately 
up to you you can't sit around and waste time 
you can't sit around and determine that everything is going to go your way because it will not go your way all the 
time but I tell you what if you keep laying around wasting time time is going 
to continue to carry on with or without you because you have already decided to 
lay in your bed because you were just too tired to get 
up it's up to you to make a difference so that you can be a Difference 
Maker it's up to you to be a solution and not a problem that means you got to 
be serious and you got to be willing and you got to be 
dedicated you got to take that leap of faith I understand it will never be easy 
I understand that I got to work I understand that sometimes I want to give 
up but I will not give up so while you're sitting around moping 
around blaming everybody for what you're not 
doing guess what nobody's going to sit around and wait for you to do the right 
thing for yourself because it's all up to 
you so just get busy you are on your 
way success doesn't have time for your excuses success doesn't have time for 
your laziness success doesn't have time for the person who doesn't truly want to 
[Music] change see I know you are scared 
but turn that fear into fire we've all been there we've all been 
afraid of something but don't give up you keep trusting you keep believing 
you keep going embrace the 
suck and keep on fighting it's okay that you fail but 
don't think you don't have what it takes don't 
doubt don't be ashamed trust in who you 
are I must work I must believe I will 
fight I will work I will 
push and I will never quit on me 
I know that I have to work I know that I have to believe I know I have to trust in 
me you got to show up sometimes we are going to have to 
just deal with the circumstances and the challenges that we 
face you can't be soft you can't be weak and expect the greatness to come 
out of you you can't expect anything good to come out of 
nothing if you're not giving nothing you get nothing now get 
up and do your work when it comes to the work ethic 
that's when you have to dig deeper that's when you have to work harder that's when you have to shut out 
all the noise and all the naysayers sometime ladies and gentlemen 
you just have to be quiet and listen to your 
passion listen to your heart listen to your 
truth it's okay sometimes because these things are going 
to happen no matter how hard you work but you don't have the right to 
give up you don't have the right to give in and stop playing a Blame 
Game and go about your business when you have been pushed back 
push back even harder I dare you to go down that path that many refuse to 
go pain passion Focus Faith you put it 
together you will be an Unstoppable Force float like a F stay like 
a I'm the biggest fighter in all history I'm the greatest fighter in all history 
and I don't have to convince nobody now that I am great they all know it I'll fight any man in the world I'll 
beat any man in the world as you know I'm a confident man I don't believe or can see anyone beat me nothing worries 
me this is nothing but a small thing that will soon be out of the way I put everything on the line cuz I'm a two 
fighting champion I got when I'm in the ring I'm handling 
it and I don't worry about nobody being that good to really hurt me so if you 
don't believe it come down here and try I'm unranked it will be no match oh 
I'm so glad I'm going to make all of them shut the mouths all of my critics I told you all 
that I was the greatest of all time I'm still the greatest of all time I'm going to float like a butterfly and and sting 
like a bee his hands can't hit what his eyes can't see nothing can stop me as 
you know I've been under all type controversy all kind of pressures but look at my face I'm the original 
Champion a veteran of 186 fights not a scratch two time United State Golden

protocol a fresh government of how you conduct 
business let me tell you something my friend the cause of your downfall will 
be because of you nobody else but you you keep looking around trying to place 
blame on things people everything else instead of looking in the mirror at oneself and looking at who caused this

look within yourself and see who did it my friend you are the one but you have 
the key to unlock that door it becomes something 
more it's your time it's your 
turn the weit is over get up and give back to 
yourself we can get so wrapped up in the swirl of business distraction and 
noise that we lose ourselves I understand my 
friend the pain it won't stop the 
suffering it won't cease and it's hard to see it it's hard to see a better 
outcome for yourself my friend I understand but look if you just 
believe and you keep believing and you hold on to that belief brighter days are 
coming WEA through the storm my friend weather through the pain and I promise 
you you will come out Victorious you just have to keep 
believing my friend if you do that you're going to be 
okay you are not a quitter you are not a one hit wonder you are called to do 
something great a lot of you really messed up the first two quarters of your life and if you're 
like me you got to believe you got a third quarter and you can a fourth quarter and after all that's been said 
and done every blessing and every battle and every memory and every image of the Past release yourself from the trauma 
torment and pain of it all step into your third quarter step into your fourth 
quarter be fully persuaded that it's your turn and it's your time I don't care what the scoreboard 
[Music] says you have an opportunity a warrior only needs one 
more opportunity to reveal to the world that he is 
more than just a 
dreamer if you're going to do something in your bloodline if you're going to pass something down generationally if 
you're going to be a light then sometimes you're going to have to get up when you don't feel like 
it you know what my friend I think you're stronger than that and I think 
you're capable of much much more so bring it out bring it out every single 
day that you live on this Earth bring it out every single day that you open your 
eyes bring it out every single day bring out the best version of yourself my 
friend because we still have work to do there are seasons and timetables and 
there are rooms I've got to walk into and there are hands that I have to shake and there are contracts that I have to 
sign and there are deals that I have to close that are going to require me to lose sleep sometimes and so if I believe 
in the power of the future that I got to be willing to get up 
you got the chance to wake up today but somebody else didn't you got the chance 
to eat your breakfast wash your face brush your teeth but somebody else did it you got the chance to walk out your 
door go to work go to school go about your day like nothing else happened but 
unfortunately somebody else did it my friend you get the chance to do it all over again but somebody else will not my 
friend take advantage of the time you have it all you 
got you do time get dialed in if you're listening 
to me let this be a moment of transformation and motivation but let 
this moment not just move you but change you to take action go back and win 
listen my friend you see you and me we're going to make it we're going to 
make it my friend we're going to make it we're going to make it my friend I promise you we're going to make it we're 
going to make it my friend we're going to make it we're going to make it my friend we're going to make it we're 
going to make it my friend we're going to make it we're got to make it my friend we're going to make it we're 
going to make it my friend but being a person that gives 
again believes again does it again picks up the pieces and tries to put the 
puzzle together again try it again and eventually winning will become a 
habit flight progress success will become our way of life our code of 
conduct our government this is what I do I'm motivated I'm dedicated I'm 
groomed I'm conditioned I'm ready to conquer the 
day you know the number one excuses I don't have enough time I always tell 
people there's 168 hours in a week if you get 8 hours sleep a 
night well there's 50 plus hours gone you still have 110 112 hours 
left if you work 60 hours a week you still have 55 hours left to go do what's 
important to you so I don't really buy the time excuse but that's the number one excuse that I hear it's time to get 
real it's time to get raw it's time to look ourselves in the mirror and come to the resolve that this version of ourself 
is not going to carry Us in the 
stretch that I've been this version of myself long enough that if I don't change if I don't do something about 
this then I'm going to find myself bankrupt a man is rewarded in public for 
what he does in in private discipline is the single most important thing that you 
can use when it comes to being successful motivation is fleeting no one 
wakes up motivated every single day the key to success that you're looking for 
the thing that's going to make your dreams come true is simple discipline 
it's doing what needs to be done even when you don't want to even when you're not 
motivated you're only disciplined once a week you're only determined twice a week 
you're only you're only enthusiastic about the journey on Sundays or Wednesdays and once you get once you get 
a covenant once you make a covenant with who you believe God has called you to be and you say you know what I'm going to 
commit to this you're going to put the blood you're going to put the sweat you're going to put the tears in you're 
going to lose sleep you're going to go days without eating you're going to do whatever it takes to make the sacrifices 
necessary to manifest we give up too early and if we 
just had a little bit of perseverance if we just worked a little bit harder and just took it a day at a 
time our dreams would come true there are too many people in your 
life who have left you there are too many people in your life who have counted you out there are too many 
people in your life who have whispered in your ear and said you'll be worse off without them prove them 
wrong when I start off my day by investing in myself I set the tone for 
the rest of my life and everything else falls into place because I've set a precedent that I'm important that I'm 
worth it that I 
matter and so I tell people invest in you first and then you have the energy 
the drive the passion to just uplift everybody else in your circle physical is the easy part see the 
physical part all you got to do is show up if you can show up again be all in ask some question maybe we'll add be 
willing to suffer a little bit into that mix you will be okay the psychological preparation 
that's a different story I always say the mind is primary and I always say say that a a strong mind is a catalyst for 
change when you see the best athletes in the world either perform really well or 
on the other hand completely bomb out it's because of that muscle that lives between the ears we only have so much 
real estate in our minds in our hearts we only have so much bandwidth and our mental capacity and the more 
distractions the more delusions the more negativity that we allow to take up real 
estate in our hearts and in our Minds the less energy we have to fulfill the 
call to fulfill Destiny to manifest the idea everything that you think about 
that you meditate on everything that has to your attention has to be worth your 
time so now it's time to navigate and do an appraisal of everything that's in our 
life everything and everybody in our life time to do an appraisal and ask it 
and ask them this question are you you worth my time if you're not it's time to 
unplug time to unplug time to unplug re rules Bobby Maximus lives by number one 
show up every single day number two when you do show up you want to be all in you 
want to be 100% present and number three be curious ask some questions along the 
way don't be scared to admit that you don't know everything and if you can learn a little bit along was showing up 
and being Allin the world is 
yours if you want to be good at something if you want to transform your body you've got to spend 130 quality 
hours and the next question I'm always asked is what does that look like it's an hour a day of dedicated practice for 
six straight months if you want something if you want 
to be good at something you want to accomplish something you've got to put in the time and the minimum amount of 
time that you can put in is an hour a day of dedicated practice for six 
straight months if you want to be good at something you've got to do it every 
day like we look at people like LeBron James why is he good at basketball because he does it every day you look at 
Wayne grexi and hockey why was Wayne so good in hockey arguably the greatest of all time because he did it every day and 
so my number one peace advice to people if you want to be good at something whatever that thing that you desire is 
whatever your passion is do it every single day that's the real secret to success we celebrate athletes and we 
celebrate critical thinkers and innovators and actors and we praise them and coin them our heroes and we follow 
them by the millions we love what they do at public but you don't know the story behind The Glory you don't know 
the Blood The Sweat you you didn't see the tears that they cried the prayers that they prayed the countless weeks 
where they went without sleep to get where they are when you see somebody that's successful your gut reaction is 
to think they're lucky they had a great trainer they had it easy if I was in 
their shoes I could do it too and the thing that I would want to say is these 
people work harder than you can imagine they show up every day they do the work 
they suffer so when you see somebody on a screen rather than criticize be 
Greatful rather than try to cut them down maybe try to learn a little bit 
from them because the the amount of dedication that goes into that craft a normal person will never understand the 
secret of change is to focus all of our energy not on fighting the old but 
building the new and specifically behind closed doors when nobody's looking when no one is there to affirm you when 
nobody's there to validate you when nobody is there to agree with you you build in the dark and you announce it 
when it's finished
